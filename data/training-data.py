	 the way forward in understanding perception has been to correlate these dimensions of experience with ,
	 firstly ,
	 the material properties of the experienced object or event  ( usually regarded as the stimulus )  and ,
	 secondly ,
	 the patterns of discharges in the sensory system .  Qualitative Aspects of Experience The quality or modality of the experience depends less upon the quality of energy reaching the nervous system than upon which parts of the sensory system are Quantitative Aspects of Experience There are three fundamental dimensions of quantity  in experience :   ( a )  intensity ;   ( b )   ( spatial )  extensity ;  and  ( c )  duration .  At a neurophysiological level ,
	the intensity of an experience is typically reflected in the number of neurones Extensity  ( for example the size of a patch of light )  usually correlates with the number and spatial distribution of receptors activated .  Finally ,
	 duration is correlated with the period of time for which the relevant neurones are active .  ( I am leaving aside phenomena such as accommodation ,

	 many of the genes carried by plasmids  such as those specifying resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin or penicillin  are flanked by special DNA which enables them to jump from plasmid to chromosome and back ,

	which Wagner's   ( 1976 ,
	 1981 )  theory of habituation ,
	 discussed at length in Chapter 2 ,
	 is also a theory of latent inhibition .  It will be recalled that ,
	 according to this theory ,
	 a stimulus is held to be fully effective only when it is able to generate the Al  ( primary activation )  state in the node that constitutes its central representation .  A node that is in the A2 ( secondary activation ) state ( either because its stimulus has only recently been presented or because it has been Estes 1950 ;  Neimark and Estes 1967 )  .  Latent inhibition is held to be a consequence of the formation of associations among these elements .  More specifically ,
	the model makes the usual associative assumption that excitatory links will be established between representations ( of elements ) that are If we accept  ( and the case has been argued in detail with respect to habituation ;  Chapter 2 ,
	 pp. 503 )  that the    presentation of S2 modify the representation of S1 that is formed ,
	 then generalization decrement will ensure that little latent inhibition will be evident after S1  S2 pre - exposure .  Kaye et al  .  ( 1988 b ) support this interpretation by demonstrating that the VS pre - exposure treatment will produce perfectly good latent inhibition when the CS used in the conditioning phase is itself vinegar followed by sucrose ,
	an arrangement that should ensure that the same representation of vinegar is 1985 )  .  Odd as this may sound ,
	 the idea that an association might be formed between a CS and the absence of some event is not without precedent in associative theorizing .  Konorski's ( 1967 ) well - developed and influential theory of conditioning deals with inhibitory learning by assuming that an inhibitory CS is one that Latent inhibition training can be expected ,
	 therefore ,
	 to establish a network of associations among the component parts that go to make up the stimulus .  McLaren ,
	 Kaye ,
	 and Mackintosh  ( 1989 )  made use of this suggestion in developing their account of latent inhibition .  Their proposal ( see Chapter 3 ) was that the associability of an element And a tendency for the responding acquired to  to generalize to  will also explain why discrimination learning which requires the subject to make different responses to the two stimuli should be retarded .  Although the S - R terminology seems well fitted to the case in which  is a verbal label ,
	 it is possible to dispense with the reliance on the notion of response - produced cues that is central to S - R theory .  As we have seen ,
	modern theories of Pavlovian conditioning assume that stimuli can Thus B would become capable of activating the US representation  ( and of evoking a CR )  by way of its ability to activate the X representation .  A and B might well have features in common from the outset  ( the c  elements in the figure )  and these will produce primary generalization  training on A will give associative strength to stimulus elements that are present also in B. The X representation functions in just the same way as the c  elements in producing generalization except for the fact that the ability of A and B to activate X is based on prior conditioning .  It should be acknowledged that not all theories of Pavlovian learning are entirely happy with the suggestion that an associatively Stimuli A and B may be regarded as physically similar to the extent that they share common ,
	 c  ,
	 elements .  The mechanism responsible for mediated generalization does nothing to increase the number or proportion of such elements and thus those wanting to cite mediated generalization as a characteristic of concept formation can assert that ,
	 in a very real sense ,
	 the similarity of the stimuli has not been changed .  But when it comes to the issue of how a given physical stimulus is actually perceived ,
	we have chosen to represent this in terms of the central representational elements that it The central question in terms of the diagram used in Fig. 5.11 ( a )   ( see also Fig. 5.10 )  is why experience of A and B should reduce the effectiveness of the c  elements in producing generalization between these stimuli .  The critical aspect of differentiation theory in this context is its assertion that exposure to A and B will lead to an increase in the number of distinctive features that can be detected .  This must mean ,
	in terms of the figure ,
	an increase in the number of a and b elements Figure 5.11 ( b )  shows an increase in the areas a  and b  with a consequent reduction in the proportion  ( although not the absolute number )  of c  elements activated by a stimulus .  figure 5.11 ( c )  presents a slightly different possibility in which the sizes of  the A and B circles have not been changed .  There is no net increase in the number of elements * Comparing the scheme shown in fig. 5.11 ( b )  with that of Fig. 5.11 ( a )  ,
	 we might expect that the presence of the extra active a  elements would produce more effective overshadowing of the c  elements during training with A. Generalization to B would therefore be reduced .  Generalization would also be reduced given the scheme shown in fig. 5.11 ( c )  .  There would again be an increase in the ability of a elements to overshadow c elements ,

Another example illustrating the importance of cytoplasmic factors in continually controlling gene activity comes from fusing mature muscle cells with cells of a completely different type .  Mature striated muscle cells make muscle - specific proteins and when such a cell is fused with a variety of other cell types which include liver and cartilage cells ,
	then muscle - specific genes are That the control of gene activity that characterizes a particular cell type is due to specific factors in the cell acting on the promoter ,
	 comes from experiments in which the promoter elements are switched around .  Genetic engineering makes it possible to join the promoter of one gene to that of another .  When this DNA construct is incorporated into the DNA of the developing embryo the protein will be made in those cells where the promoter is Many copies were  injected and some of them inserted ,
	 almost randomly ,
	 into the DNA of the nucleus of a fertilized mouse egg .  The egg was then allowed to develop and all the cells of the embryo now contained multiple copies of the growth hormone gene and its new promoter .  Shortly after birth ,
	the mouse was fed water containing traces of metal ,
	so The state of a cell can ,
	 in principle ,
	 be described by its genetic activity  which genes are switched on and off .  Development can in this sense be viewed in terms of the changing networks of gene activity in  different  cells .  Activation of one gene can lead to the synthesis of a protein which But what commits the muscle to this final pathway and what ensures that all the necessary genes are turned on at the same time ?  In the case of muscle it seems that there is a master gene controlling the expression of all the main genes ,
	 known as myogenin and it is always switched on in mature muscle cells .  Its special property is that it can The effect of introducing just this one gene is to switch off some genes and to set in train a sequence of gene activation so that the cell develops into a muscle cell with all the appropriate proteins  master gene is an appropriate description .  But whether this is peculiar to muscle ,
	 or whether other master genes will be found ,
	 remains to be discovered .  One can imagine how an external signal could Initial experiments were performed on porcine platelets stimulated by thrombin but subsequently many substances  ( secretagogues )  have been found to provoke platelet aggregation :  ADP ,
	 adrenaline and collagen as well as thrombin provoked release of 5 - hydroxytryptamine and nucleotides from platelets  ( Mills et al ,
	 1968 )  .  In addition ,
	 immune complexes  ( Humphrey  Jaques ,
	 1955 )  ,
	 arachidonic acid  ( Kaplan et al ,
	 1979 )  and thromboxane A 2   ( Hamberg et al ,
	 1975 )  cause platelet release .  More recently ,
	the degranulating action of platelet - Thromboxane A 2  is a more powerful pro - aggregatory substance in platelets than the endoperoxides ,
	 and it has been proposed that it is the arachidonic acid metabolite that mediates platelet aggregation and the release reaction  ( Hamberg et al ,
	 1975 )  .  Whether platelet endo - peroxides have a proaggregatory role in their own right or only when converted to thromboxane A 2  has been the subject of many studies  ( Bunting et al ,
	 1983 )  .  However ,
	from experiments using thromboxane synthetase inhibitors it appears that when platelets are However ,
	 from experiments using thromboxane synthetase inhibitors it appears that when platelets are activated and the prostaglandin cascade is triggered by release of endogenous arachidonic acid then the endoperoxides generated exert their proaggregatory effects by their conversion to the more potent compound thromboxane A 2  .  However ,
	 when the thromboxane generation is suppressed it is probable that endoperoxides can be proaggregatory themselves  ( Bunting et al ,
	 1983 )  .  It has been proposed that endoperoxides and thromboxane A 2 There are a variety of sulphonylurea agents available for the therapy of diet - failed non - insulin - dependent diabetic subjects ,
	 varying mainly in their half - life and mode of excretion .  In addition to their hypoglycaemic action it is probable that some or all of these compounds may have antiplatelet effects .  Thus gliclazide depresses various parameters of platelet function in vitro and appears to inhibit arachidonate release from platelet phospholipids ( Tsuboi et al ,

	 but it certainly involves the increased production of two particular enzymes .  The first of these enzymes makes an unusual series of oligonucleotide molecules with the general name of 2' 5' oligoadenylate .  These molecules go on to The second interferon - induced enzyme adds a phosphate group to a protein that is essential for the synthesis of new proteins to begin .  Addition of this phosphate group impairs the function of the essential protein ,

Both enzymes appear to be Several  research  groups have performed clinical trials with a simple synthetic RNA called polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid  ( polyl : C )  .  While interferon production was certainly induced by this compound its efficacy in treating viral infections bas so far been disappointing .  Another idea thrown up by interferon research has been to make synthetic analogues of the 2' 5' oligoadenylate molecules formed in response to interferon and which Of course the actions of carcinogens on methylase activity in a test - tube may not reflect what happens in tissues exposed to those chemicals .  But it has recently been shown quite independently by Andrew Feinberg and Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University that the DNA of tumour cells is much less methylated than that of normal cells from the same tissue .  All of which lends circumstantial weight to the idea that oncogenes may be In man ,

	 Their work on a virus - induced lymphoma of birds inspired the researchers to look specifically for the myc  gene  rather than for any of the 13 other known proto - oncogenes .  The bird virus studied by Hayward and his co - workers does not contain its own oncogene and is very much less efficient in causing cancer than those viruses that do .  They suspected that it might work by inserting its own genes and in particular the promotor DNA that The horizontal distance from the staff to the surveying source is measured automatically :  the beam geometry gives a coarse value ,

	 but fortunately it is possible to rely on more than assumption .  The advantage of this sort of work is that the descriptions of cellular mechanisms are very detailed and this provides a good basis for determining whether the same cellular mechanisms are available in mammals .  For example ,
	plasticity seems to depend on identifiable ion channels and catalytic molecules that Each of the input neurons connects to every output neuron .  Output neurons can be activated in one of two ways ,
	 either by the output pattern generator line ,
	 or by the input cells .  The input cells are The input cells are activated only by sensory input .  The system is designed so that it will learn to generate output patterns in response to input patterns .  It can do this because the capacity of an input neuron to activate any of the output neurons increases every time the output pattern generator What emerges from this work is the complexity of the interactions between components of the system .

	 or does it work on a trigger basis so that ,
	 once a level of activity has been exceeded ,
	 the actual level is irrelevant ?  For example ,
	if a cell doubles its discharge rate under one set of conditions but quadruples under another ,

	 Elizabeth A. Harrington  Gerard I. Evan THE bcl - 2 proto - oncogene is Expression of Bcl - 2 completely inhibits the onset of apoptosis in serum - deprived Rat - 1 cells after c - Myc activation ,
	 as shown in Fig. 2 .  It is important to determine whether Bcl - 2 blocks c - Myc - induced proliferation as well as apoptosis :  the synergy between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 can easily be rationalized if Bcl - 2 blocks only the apoptotic function of c - Myc and leaves its mitogenic activity unaffected .  We examined the mitotic rate of Rat - 1/c - Myc - ER cells that were proliferating in low serum under the influence of - oestradiol - Our results demonstrate that acquisition of constitutive Bcl - 2 expression is an example of such a mutation .  Bcl - 2 mitigates the apoptotic effects of deregulated c - Myc expression without affecting its ability to promote continuous cell growth ,
	 so providing a mechanistic basis for the oncogenic synergy between these two proto - oncogenes .  The interaction between c - Myc and Bcl - 2 differs from the usual form of oncoprotein cooperation as observed between c - Myc and Thymidine block .  Exponentially growing Rat - 1/c - Myc - ER and Rat - 1/c - Myc - ER/Bcl - 2 cells were arrested in S phase by addition of 2mM thymidine to the growth medium for a period of 24h as  described  .  c - Myc was then Consistent with this idea ,

The deletion mutant Myc N ( retaining residues 178 to 439 ) fails to Bacteria adapt to the lethal effects of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide by inducing the expression of protective stress genes .  Analogous responses have been identified in human cells .  For example ,

	 the percentage of cases that could be attributable to this genotype was 8 %  in the whole population and 35 %  in the low - risk group .  The values of these estimates indicate a strong impact of the ACE/ID  polymorphism on myocardial infarction in the population .  ACE exists predominantly as an ectoenzyme of vascular endothelial cells and plays a key part in the renin - angiotensin and kallikrein - kinin systems by In our system ,

The best understood form of long - term potentiation is induced by the activation of the  receptor complex .  This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long - term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics ,
	and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which ,
	in turn ,
	are thought to When many fibres are activated in synchrony by a strong stimulus ,
	 depolarization spreads between neighbouring synapses to enhance the unblocking of NMDA channels .  Associativity has a similar explanation except that the required depolarization is provided by a different set of afferent fibres ;  in theory ,

	 depolarization is often provided by injecting current into the cell .  Input - specificity is explained by the need for the presynaptic terminal to provide a sufficient concentration of L - glutamate to There is general agreement that PKC inhibitors will block LTP if they are applied after the tetanus ,

	not only After boiling the hopped wort flows from the copper into a vessel called a hop back .  Like the mash tun ,
	 it has a slotted base and the liquid runs out of the vessel over a bed of spent hops .  The wort is then cooled and run into fermenting tanks where yeast is The remaining yeast continues to turn the residual sugars into alcohol and also helps to purge the beer of the rough after - tastes created by fermentation .  Some brewers add extra sugar at this stage to encourage the continuing fermentation .  Caramel is sometimes The finings attract yeast and other particles and begin to drag them to the bottom of the tank .  Now the beer is ready for the final stage in the brewery before it leaves for the pub cellar .  It is run or racked into casks ,

	 or believe the artificial ,
	 standardised historic pub interior to be preferable to genuine historic detail ,
	 when the original internal divisions and features are essential elements of the historic character that customers expect when entering such a building .   The Duke's  Arms at Presteigne in Powys provides the perfect illustration of how the misguided quest for the ideal traditional pub character can seriously threaten genuine historic features .  This pub was originally a 17th century timber frame jettied building ; in the early 19th century its front was removed and a new rendered facade Now nothing remains whatsoever of the old fittings ,
	 features or proportions ;  in their place is a vast ,
	 open - plan space with bright white walls ,
	 bistro furniture and cheery chintz .  A similar treatment was recently meted out by Allied's  Tetley Walker subsidiary to what remains a fundamentally Georgian pub in an urban setting near Manchester  the Church Inn at Lowton .  Having applied cement render over the external brickwork ,

	 that would make sense both for families and for the tourist and leisure industry .  At the other end of the tourist season ,
	 Britain has a log - jam of holiday weekends ,
	 particularly if Easter is late ,
	 when it is followed closely by May Day and not much later by the spring bank holiday .  The NEDC Committee suggests that one of these could be transplanted to October but why not move them further apart ,
	and However ,
	 the most up - to - date leaflet available to the catering industry  leaflet 709 published in February 1990  clearly states that cold takeaway food is zero - rated in hotels .  Their new interpretation is illegal ,
	 said Martin Hill ,
	 proprietor of the Coul House Hotel in Ross - Shire .  In most cases ,
	the hotels Caterer spoke to had offered guest prices that were inclusive of VAT or the tax was simply I would have thought the UK hotelier would have nothing to fear from a European directive ,
	 he said .  It is possible an EC directive would be at the same level or just below UK standards .  He UK Fire Certificates might say hotels must have a warning system but might not specify the means ,
	 Mr Kidd said .  The directive will say hotels of a certain size will have to have an automatic fire detection system permanently linked to a manned location for calling the fire brigade .  He Richard Jarram ,
	 senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in London ,
	 explained that the changes were designed to help India reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund  ( IMF )  .  The IMF will not lend any money unless India shows it is doing something about putting its house in order ,
	 he explained .  He We feel the arrangements will assist in development opportunities ,
	 he said .  However ,
	 from a management company perspective ,
	 we feel that doing business there very much depends on associating with the right partner .  Mr Hirst PUBLIC COMPLAINT WAS UNFAIR EVERYONE is entitled to their opinion ,
	 and while I agree with Joe Hyam's  concerning service charges  (  Caterer  ,
	 1521 August )  ,
	 I feel he is taking unfair advantage of his position to have a go at people who do not do things the Joe Hyam way .  If the restaurant in question Head of the school Mike McKechnie later visited Shanghai to seal a friendship agreement and discuss the course content ,

	  Charles Mobbs As Lodgistix account manager Phillip Wanbon points out ,
	different packages require different timescales for training ,
	but he There is some justification for this caricature of the typical computer user  though customers'  critics might ask themselves first how well - written the manuals are ,
	 before complaining that people never read them .  Assuming the manual is in comprehensible English ,
	 users can avoid many unnecessary calls to the help desk by a combination of consulting its index ,
	 and using the onscreen help built into the software .  Pabulum Consultants' Jennifer Rust This is part of the Catering  Allied philosophy of link manning  people need to be able to pick up their colleagues'  responsibilities if necessary ,

	 probably for ever .  Business people  no longer prepared to spend five hours or more on a daytime Euston - Glasgow journey  had switched to air ,
	 while leisure travellers had been lured away by the bargain - priced coaches .  To offset the loss of Glasgow business ,
	extra stops were Indeed ,
	 for a time it enabled the service to become an all HST operation so that some places actually had a better service .  There were four major East Coast developments in the 1980s :  the significant increase in HST productivity so that sets could be more extensively deployed to provide service to Inverness ,
	 Glasgow Queen Street ,
	 Hull and Cleethorpes ;  electrification of the route from Hitchin to Leeds with only minor interference to train services ;  introduction of a new track - maintenance strategy and transfer of overnight Anglo - Scottish sleeping - car services to the West Coast main line .  Although the original HST plans provided for two daily return journeys between King's Cross and Aberdeen ,
	by judicious programming of the sets ( plus some extra sets transferred from the Western region ) it was possible to LSE went out with a bang rather than a whimper .  12 May was marked by the introduction of no less than four new electric services ;  on the Eastern Region branch lines between Wickford and Southminster and between  Romford and Upminster ;  on the Great Eastern main line between Manningtree and Harwich ;  and  ( at last )  over the thirty - two miles between Tonbridge and Hastings .  The Hastings 20m scheme was celebrated by a successful Gala Day on 27 April when unlimited travel over the line for only 1 was available and more formally on 6 May when the Queen Mother  ( Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports )  travelled over the line in the Royal Train .  In preparation for electrification ,
	sufficient Class 411 units had been repainted in Jaffa cake livery and branded the 1066 Electrics to give They incorporated all the Mark 3 features of air conditioning ,
	 insulation and good riding .  But they were just at the design stage when early on a July morning in 1978 twelve passengers died in a fire on Mark 1 sleeping cars of the Penzance to Paddington overnight train .  As a result the design was modified to include much greater fire resistance ,
	Many of the reopenings were under the Speller rule :  Tony Speller's  1981 Bill made it possible for services to reopen experimentally without the need to go through the formal closure procedures in the event of failure .  Some were the direct result of campaigning by the Railway Development Society and the list is almost a tribute to it .  It should be Steam - heated hauled stock was also eradicated ,
	 and the response was the reclassification of more Class 31/4s and 47/4s ,
	 plus the first Class 37/4s .  Longer - term planning forced BR to embark upon life - extension programmes for several locomotive types expected to be needed until well into the 1990s ,

	involving replacement of the main generator with an alternator ,
	regeared CP7 bogies ,
	and in some cases Ruston or Mirrlees power unit ,
	electric - heat generator ,
	or ballast weights Not all the results were of the same high quality ;  nevertheless the music they arranged reinforced the choreographer's  design by giving the plot atmosphere ,
	 local colour ,
	 continuity and flow as well as giving the dancing its rhythmic vitality ,
	 emotion and mood .  In some cases it also helped to underline the main moments in the action by emphasising gestures for greater strength and expression .  In other cases they Steps of petite and grande lvation  It is not enough merely to consider how to perform the five jumps as a technical exercise .  They must have quality given to them because their varying dimensions can There are many other instances of Ashton's  witty beaten touches that may only become apparent after several viewings and are to be found in Birthday Offering ,

	 La Fille Mal Garde  and elsewhere .  Pirouettes  In the same way as steps of batterie and grande lvation ,
	pirouettes are usually employed to It is not easy to achieve this effect if they do not take into account the dimension and spacing of the steps as well as their particular quality ,
	 which must be in tune with the music if it is to make sense .  A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can A sudden change of aulement  ,
	 an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,
	 or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift changes The most outstanding are Scottish ,
	 Italian and Spanish .  Scottish style  The Royal Danish Ballet's  production of La Sylphide  is evidence of Bournonville's  imaginative use of the Scot's  quick light footwork and capers as well as the very distinctive Highland ports de bras  ,
	 which help the dancer to sustain balance .  To these features he It was then expanded by Fokine and used in both grave and gay moods in Les Sylphides  and Le Carnaval  ,
	 where it is particularly expressive of both meaning and music .  In both ballets he incorporated several conventional gestures in the ports de bras  but also demanded    greater emotional involvement from the dancers .  These changes Although some modern dancers do without music in the accepted sense of that term ,
	 they rarely do without rhythmic phrasing .  If they do they have forgotten that ,
	 like them ,
	 every member of their audience has an inborn sense of measuring time .  .  .  Without a sense of rhythm ,

	Enriched hop powder pellets are also possible by sieving the powder at  35C to remove coarser non a  acid material and by blending with liquid extracts to further enhance the a  acid content .  Pellets may also be stabilised by the inclusion of vitamin C  ( ascorbic acid )  to reduce oxidation .  Calcium and magnesium salts may then be Moreover the extraction leaves undesirable chemicals such as pesticides behind .  Carbon dioxide also offers the flexibility to separate the hop components into bitter and flavour fractions .  This advantage is considerable since the bitter fraction may then be chemically manipulated to produce bitter iso a acids from the a acids and so provide a PIKE product which may be Dry hop flavour is an interesting application since the use of a liquid extract allows a more accurate and consistent flavour to be produced .  Moreover whole hops used for dry hopping take seven to 10 days for the character to be extracted and then slowly decline .  Dry hop extract provides immediate character which lasts longer and reduces the possibility of infection being There is no such decline with extracts .  Within 30 years the brewing industry has gone from a cottage industry to high tech .  English Hops began their development of hop oils by looking at the dry hopping end of the brewing process ,

Roth would The Facts  is able to treat the historical conditioning of Portnoy's  Complaint  in a way in which the novel itself was not in a position to do .  It has the  benefit of hindsight .

	 and the experience of the assimilated Jew in Italy ,
	 where the Jews came to harm under Mussolini but where they were never the strangers they have been in several other countries ,
	 is summarised in a well - informed and pertinent fashion .  At the same time ,
	the article is tainted by what seems to be a desire to inflict damage on Levi's reputation ,
	of a kind which may be thought to serve the ideological tendency of the magazine in which it Arabs who had been expelled from their land and thrust into the condition of Jewish refugees are hereby reformulated as imperialist aggressors and as Nazis .  This is reminiscent of the sort of inversion a fault - finding literary criticism can produce  which is not to deny ,
	 which is indeed to admit ,
	 that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults ,
	 including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary  .  The magazine's line on such matters would also Let us praise ,

	 the Church of Ireland experienced continuing rounds of church closures and became top - heavy in numbers of clergy .  Statistics up to 1971 showed it as having an old - age structure and to have been in continuing decline ,
	 though there are recent signs of improvement  ( Census of Ireland 1981 )  .  Southern protestants do not The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland .  They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist parties ,
	 Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party ,
	 though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism .  Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two parties ,
	a substantial number of their voters do not The occasional independent unionist and independent Orange - lodge representative in politics were a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 .  The Northern Ireland Labour Party also was the principal organization representing protestant trade unionists .  But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization ,
	much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists ,
	which always It is clear that in the past many of them have considered loyalty to be a two - way process ,
	 a contract or covenant ,
	 and that the state could be a traitorous party as well as the people .  The tradition proved of crucial importance in forming the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until British recognition of their separate political claim in 1914 .  If the tradition still exists today and it It is important to note that in 191214 the protestant  loyalist group saw their right to violence as prior to that of the official state .  It is also important to note that they saw the taking of law into their own hands as temporary ,
	 and pending the recognition by that state of its mistaken attitude towards them and their right to a degree of autonomy .  It There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ;  but it had been based on industrial workers ,
	 particularly in the shipyards ,
	 and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart .  As Gibbon has noted ,
	 the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles  ( 1975 :  3 )  .  The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes The historical consciousness of Ulster protestants in this sphere is also a  faith consciousness .  The salvation history of the Bible is coupled with what is seen as a significant period in the history of the protestants of Ireland .  The key event in the history of Ireland which The key event in the history of Ireland which appears to encapsulate Ulster protestant faith in God through Christ and the destiny of Ulster protestants as a people ,
	 is the war of 168991 .  William of Orange is seen to have worked the decisive victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 .  However ,
	that myth is not quite the one which However ,
	 the earthly role of the community ,
	 be it protestant or catholic ,
	 is not seen as secondary to the religious message ,
	 but as either in continuity with or against it .  The Calvinist vision of an earthly city in which pastor and politician work in harmony to exclude evil from the lives of all those within the city walls remains a religious outlook for a significant number of protestant loyalists .  This is a totalizing view of society ,
	and implies a certain anti - pluralism : freedom of belief and action within certain parameters ,
	which are to be decided either by those who First there is the fact of statehood ,
	 with the implied acceptance of law and order by the people .  Second ,
	 there is the unifying dominant beliefs of Irish catholic nationalism .  The distinct importance of the two sources Generally speaking ,
	 there is evidence that the church has always tended to support the hegemony of the state qua  state .  It supported the British state for most of the nineteenth century in Ireland ,
	 then supported constitutional politics for home rule ;  and when independence came in 1921 ,
	 it supported the pro - treaty faction in Southern Ireland and opposed the civil war because that faction was the state .  It would As has already been seen ,
	 it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known ,
	 which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade ,
	 but one which it was felt by both interested parties had to be maintained ,
	 probably so as not to confuse the faithful .  In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 ,
	 while an extensive health bill was going through parliament ,
	 the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority ,
	 without qualification ,
	 is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family ,
	 the Church in education ,
	 the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions  (  Irish Independent  ,
	 12 Apr. 1951 ,
	 quoted Whyte 1980 :  143 )  .  It Later the hierarchy made it clear that the basis for their objections was the increase in power by the state vis -  - vis  the liberty and self - reliance of its citizens which such legislation would entail .  Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his party On the one hand ,
	 the laity would not understand the complexity of the issues because of their poor understanding of Christian doctrine and the intricacies of morality ;  on the other ,
	 the area of the sacred in the political arena was clearly defined ,
	 and clear guidance from the clerical church was both necessary and expected by good Christian politicians .  What the bishops and the politicians had come up against in the Mother and Child controversy was that this paternalistic conceptualization was intrinsically at odds with the common understanding of democracy .  This This appears to be the first contradiction which the bishops later sought to resolve by withdrawing from the direct contact method .  It indicates that a real change did eventually take place after all ,
	 in so far as freedom of information and the inappropriateness of direct consultation without public mediation eventually became accepted as something which ,
	 at worst ,
	 had to be risked and something which ,
	 at best ,
	 formed an essential task of the construction of a Christian conscience in a Christian society .  This ,
	however ,
	was the only contradiction which Many of these had just as much sense of loyalty and devotion to the church as the middle classes .  Large sections of the population ,
	 the subordinate classes specifically ,
	 were desperately in need of improved health care. Many of them Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,
	 they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .  But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation .  In addition ,
	the clergy Furthermore ,
	 the ranks of that clergy were drawn from the common people themselves .  But a key element remained the considerable filial loyalty the catholic nationalists showed towards their clergy ,
	 bishops ,
	 and Popes .  The authority of the clergy had been second to none during the years of persecution and this But a key element remained the considerable filial loyalty the catholic nationalists showed towards their clergy ,
	 bishops ,
	 and Popes .  The  authority of the clergy had been second to none during the years of persecution and this appears to have strengthened as a direct result of Roman centralization from the 1850s onwards .  This respect for authority has The Conference would wish all who may take part in the referendum to recognize that Protestant Churches are pro - Life but anti - amendment and to query whether they wish a clause in the constitution unacceptable to Protestant churches .  ( Methodist Church in Ireland 1983 :  48 )  The position taken by the protestant churches ,
	and the newspaper articles and television debates which preceded the referendum While preparing an early draft of the present chapter ,
	 the writer heard Bishop Cathal Daly of Down and Connor ,
	 a leading moderate among the bishops ,
	 respected by all except PIRA ,
	 repeat the adage that the Irish constitution was secular ,
	 implying that there really was little to be done for the moment .  This in fact was the main tack in the bishops'  attitude to the forum .  There The Divorce Debate Almost as if to test the political religious alliance of catholic nationalists in the South ,
	 the constitutional issue of divorce arose in 1986 as part of Dr Garret FitzGerald's  constitutional crusade  ( see Cooney 1986 )  to make the Southern state more palatable to Northerners .  FitzGerald had been determined as far back as 1964 ( 1964 ; 1972 ) to make constitutional changes to those articles which Large publicity campaigns began and the Irish Times  also lent its weight to the pro - divorce argument ,
	 campaigning in its columns until the eve of the referendum in late June. Though the coalition government were allowing their TDs  the Irish equivalent for MPs  a free vote on the issue ,
	 its parties ,
	 Fine Gael and Labour ,
	 officially sponsored the campaign for the constitutional change .  Fianna Fil Protestant churches were not unaffected by the spirit in which the campaign often appeared to be conducted .  Some members of the anti - abortion lobby had apparently been indicating the weak moral stance of protestants on the issue .  The Church of Ireland There seemed to be the fairly uncomplicated desire among the community to see all the children attend the same school ,
	 as an expression of relationships existing within the community .  It is likely that children have the important function in a new housing area of bringing parents and neighbours together ,
	 particularly when there is a lack of other social amenities  a characteristic of new housing areas in and around Dublin in the 1970s .  The children probably But where other churches have owned their own schools ,
	 as does the Church of Ireland in the South ,
	 a similar position has been adopted ,
	 though the reasons for the position have been on different grounds .  A proposal before the Church of Ireland synod in May 1979 to support interdenominational education was defeated ,
	 despite pressure from its ecumenical lobby .  The main grounds Goldberg taking out his polka - dotted handkerchief and wiping his brow ,

	although strengthening of the fixed coach rakes meant the final augmentation trailer did not Added to that was the desire to eradicate all vehicles with asbestos insulation by 1988 ,
	 a target not in fact achieved .  The truism that you get what you pay for was ably demonstrated by the decision in 1981 to replace ageing first - generation DMU fleets on non -   electrified outer suburban lines and remote branches with low - cost bus - type bodies on four - wheeled underframes .  The prototype Leyland two - car Class 140 unit But this was only innovative in so far as classical ballet was concerned as there are many 5/4 Slav folk dances .  Ashton makes brilliant use of this in his version of the solo ,
	 phrasing the steps so that a jump upwards can last three beats followed by two short steps or two beats followed by a long and then a short step .  Taking time in the air makes leaps By repetition ,
	 he did not mean that every time a phrase was repeated it had to be the same .  On the contrary ,
	 he also asserted that it needed variation .  For example ,
	the six male dancers do not always Instead ,
	 he used what he called mimed dance or danced mime ,
	 insisting ,
	 when asked fur an explanation ,
	 that there was a subtle difference between them ,
	 only one of degree .  To Fokine ,
	 Les Sylphides  was mimed dance because he had incorporated a few conventional gestures into his choreography .  Fokine said that every phrase of his dance was a gesture ,
	and explained : Undoubtedly an arabesque has many meanings but only when it This is usually performed extempore ,
	 following the whims of the singer ,
	 musician and/or dancer .  It is therefore slightly erratic in phrase ,
	 rhythm and tune .  Such irregularity makes these conversations This marks their first exchange of vows ,
	 which is reiterated when Lise pretends to harness Colas by the ribbons to a trap of which she is the driver .  But not for long ,
	 for they make another pledge by tying themselves together in a cat's  cradle .  Ribbons That is ,
	 the choreographer must understand from which part of the body impetus is to be given so that the step achieves its full purpose at the proper moment  usually in some gesture and its musical emphasis .  The moment can be as the dancer pauses momentarily in a pose ,
	 as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence .  Or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space ,
	such as the moment in a grand jet en avant when the dancer's two legs are at an equal height from the ground and he or she This required a knowledge of the theory of numbers and geometrical design ,
	 of singing and playing some musical instrument ,
	 of composing poems ,
	 of dancing ,
	 fencing and sword play ,
	 as well as of practising the fashionable sports and pastimes .  This study of the Muses in the widest sense was reflected in the work of such balletmasters as Beaujoyeulx ,
	 producer of the first ballet de cour  and later by Beauchamps ,
	 dancing master to Louis XIV .  The same types of generalised character continued and still It can be that magic moment in such dances as the Rose Adage in The  Sleeping Beauty  when Aurora triumphantly raises her hand from the fourth Prince's  grasp and holds the final attitude  for several seconds revealing her complete command over the forces of gravity .  There are hundreds of instances of this kind of pose created by many different choreographers .  There is the moment in the Act II pas de deux or Swan Lake where Odette Anyone using steel backs to their shoes can still do this .  There is no light and shade and this way of using the pointes  has nothing to do with giving a finishing touch to such dances as those fur Petipa's  Aurora and the Six Fairies in The Sleeping Beauty  to make them seem lighter than air .  Nor does it resemble the bravura footing of Kitri in the Don Quixote pas de deux or the passages in Ashton's Ondine where his ballerina The originality of so much of   Ashton's  and MacMillan's  choreography fur classical ballets lies in the way they follow the basic principles and rules in order to create an infinite variety of enchanements  from the traditional vocabulary of steps ,
	 and yet discard the conventions .  Birthday Offering  Ashton's  technical virtuosity  ( The Royal Ballet )  Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers' behaviour will when the members of the newly founded french academies laid down rules for all artists at the court of Louis XIV ,
	 they had to conform whether they were painters ,
	 sculptors or designers of scenery ,
	 props and tapestries .  The rules stated that artistic works had to be inspired by the ancient Greek arts ,
	 be symmetrical ,
	 properly proportioned and balanced round a centre .  These edicts were particularly important for all concerned in the opera - ballets in which the king himself frequently some actors today ,
	 notably Sir John Gielgud ,
	 use them when playing in classical drama and some eighty are still part of a dancer's  means of telling a story in classical style .  They have become part of the spacious ports de bras  used during the dance .  They conform to the same technical rules as ports de bras and must From such ideas he formed dances which did away with pointes  but retained much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinated with the less familiar action of the arms and hands .  Thus the angular and straight lines drawn by the legs were also drawn simultaneously by the arms and hands ,
	 which were allowed to cross the centre line of the body ,
	 very often with a twist sideways at the waist .  This made the dancers This was followed by a wedding staged as if the Bride and Groom were being manipulated as puppets by a group of servants ,
	 a particular japanese theatrical tradition .  The final scene was a formal celebration and prayer fur a wife giving birth .  The movements were strongly influenced by the stylised Bugako players and were appropriate to each scene ,
	but oddly enough the whole The words speak a philosophy known and believed in China for many centuries .  Nautical styles  Although few characters from the professions Military style  Today very little military demi - caractre  style exists in Western ballet except in such American works as Balanchine's  Stars and Stripes  ,
	 but it played a large part during the nineteenth century .  It was then taken over by such excellent troupes as the Tiller and Jackson Girls who toured widely over Europe and America and later by the Drum Majorettes ,
	who have also They ride ,
	 fence and parry with swords ,
	 and sing a song with a lute .  The gestures they make are at one with their interesting footwork .  The footwork Ashton looks back to Petipa's  more formal style because it is suitable for Mendelssohn's  music .  Despite Puck's  wild leaps ,
	 crazy antics and turns ,
	 the clumsy attempts by the Mechanicals to cut capers and Bottom's  efforts sur les pointes  ,
	 it is Oberon and Titania's  dancing that commands the stage as well as those trapped in the magicked Athenian wood .  from their first confrontation ,
	when Titania It does not develop into the passionate circling en l air  that occurs when the Tutor swings Natalia round as she rests on his knee before they ultimately turn to face each other and embrace .  This particularly subtle quiver of the leg to express newly aroused emotion was first noticed in Ashton's  The Two Pigeons  when the Young Girl and her friends pretend to strut around like pigeons .  But when she repeats the movement in her dance with the Young Man ,
	it Steps should be classified under the terms used in the classical vocabulary so that they have a commonly recognised form ,
	 e.g. the three changes of weight required by the Russian Kolokol or bell step and the Hungarian Harang make them pas de  bourre  ,
	 whilst the goat's  leap known in several countries becomes the pas de chat  .  2 Emphasis must be placed on certain steps and their qualities which 3 In order to display particular native features ,
	 the traditional circle ,
	 chain and couple dance formations must be broken up and opened outwards so that the steps are seen clearly by the audience .  This is after all what the first balletmasters did when professionals The partnership between boy and girl must be carefully observed and timed because each country has its own forms for such joint movement .  Hungarian The couples frequently face each other looking into each other's faces and ( See page 95 for other characteristics .  )  Polish The boy's way of Alain was played as an idiot who hardly danced at all except to full over his own feet .  In fact they were stereotypes ,

	 superior servants and prostitutes .  This is useful when telling a story ,
	particularly as prostitutes It is worth noting that such important modern choreographers as Kurt Jooss and Martha Graham and the leader of the Dance Theatre of Harlem ,
	 George Mitchell ,
	 insisted that their dancershave knowledge of some school of classical technique ,
	 to which they added other exercises to develop the flexibility of their dancers'  bodies ,
	 athletic qualities and an ability to explore more thoroughly the space around them in all its dimensions .  The additional exercises certainly led to a greater use of patterns made by the dancers rolling or posturing over and on the floor .  This gave greater depth to most of the patterns ,
	but often made the dancers This gave greater depth to most of the patterns ,
	 but often made the dancers appear earthbound .  It also led to closer contacts between the dancers as they moved from picture to picture within the design .  From time to time this can be very beautiful but because there is a lack of continuity in the dance movement from one picture to the next ,

	 and development .  Were he to say any such thing we would be left with a therapeutic murder .  But again Dostoevsky is fumbling after a creative or regenerative suffering ,
	because it is of the essence of Raskolnikov's questions ,
	desires ,
	feelings ,
	and so forth ( which of course do Were he to say any such thing we would be left with a therapeutic murder .  But again Dostoevsky is fumbling after a creative or regenerative suffering ,
	 because it is of the essence of Raskolnikov's  questions ,
	 desires ,
	 feelings ,
	 and so forth  ( which of course do appear in the novel )  that they should be agonized .  The fictional morphology of this suffering is more aptly suggested by the novelist and critic Akhsharumov ,
	writing the very year Crime and Punishment We do .  He is just surprised .  On the surface of his mind lies the contrast between a trivial though tormenting fear and a monstrous scheme ; and beneath that contrast Being gripped by a narrative is an altogether wider notion than what is presaged by the two - in - one of being outside yet inside Raskolnikov's  strange smile :  the rehearsal of the murder ,
	 the murder sequence itself ,
	 the three long duels with the detective Porfiry ,
	 the suffering ,
	 the hesitation ,
	 the final climb up the police - station stairs .  Dostoevsky's  own attempt to suggest how he disposes his reader in relation to these events goes as follows :  Narration by the author ,
	 a sort of invisible but omniscient being who nevertheless doesn't leave him meaning his hero' for a moment So ,
	after The notebooks show Svidrigailov developing from a minor into a major character while Crime and Punishment  was being planned and written ,
	 and they show his growth as interdependent with Raskolnikov's  final definition .  In some early drafts Raskolnikov commits suicide ,
	 and the striking thing here is that it's  never suggested he does so out of remorse or because he thinks he's  going to get caught or even from some vaguer ,
	 larger self - loathing .  He He only knows that he needs air and can't get it ;  a state evinced by  his terminal boredom ,
	 and by single sovereign descriptive strokes like the fact that his eyes are a little too blue leaving the reader to imagine a pair of empty summer - sky souls ,
	 very bright and staring in pain .  One of the marvels of Crime and Punishment  is its clear distinguishing ,
	 untainted by clinical knowingness ,
	 of Svidrigailov's  and Raskolnikov's  ways of being  ( as the saying is )  not with us .  Svidrigailov The second draft introduces the sister and cuts the thinking to himself .  The magazine text brings in the paradox of public and yet as if  private utterance :  His words were as if spoken to himself ,
	 but he spoke them aloud ,
	 and he continued for some time to look at his sister like a man perplexed .  And that is how the passage ( iv )  Among Crime and Punishment's   major characters only Porfiry the detective is in no sense an arriver .  It will It is to steal his own clothes ,
	 and by the time he comes to Sonya to confess ,
	 the Napoleonic idea is already crumbling into wanting to dare or something even vaguer .  And nobody else can be a Napoleon either .  A Napoleon is a non - person ,
	a generalhuman ; and although the word doesn't The word appears twice in Dostoevsky's  letter to Katkov outlining Crime and Punishment  ,
	 in the phrase unsteadiness of ideas  which is natural since a drama of reflection is about to unfold :  thinking is Raskolnikov's  work ,
	 as he tells the maid Nastasya .  Unsteady work ,
	 we might add .  Moreover the surname Shatov Dostoevsky wrote for Stankevich's  published critical study of Granovsky  material absolutely indispensable for my work ,
	 a life - and - death necessity like air .  All was bustle and confidence .  In the earlier Possessed notebooks Granovsky This is the rationale of the movement from a decent man to the habits of a decent man. Stavrogin can't ,
	 and in our definitive text doesn't ,
	 claim to be a decent man or to have any other thing to be ;  all his letter indicates is a deathlike mime or sleepwalk within behaviour patterns determined by upbringing ,
	 class ,
	 and kind .   This must He looks a bit ill ,
	 smiles vaguely ,
	 and has a strange rather shy expression .  His furniture is a jumble of good and bad ;  a magnificent Bokhara carpet lies next to straw mats ,
	 and engravings of fashionable society and sacred icons confront one another .  He But on the contrary ,
	 this world of it was rumoured and that may well have been so followed at once by it is more likely that nothing of the sort happened  again in the opening paragraphs  is as exhilarating as the challenge of life's  opacities to a healthy curiosity .  Indeed the overall triumph of art in this case is that the novel walks out into our fact rather than ourselves entering its fiction :  a very primitive and absolute form of consumer capitulation .  Dostoevsky has an impudent way of making his narrator declare As a chronicler I confine myself to presenting events exactly as they happened ,
	and it's not my fault if they A single ma cannot divine fully the eternal and universal ideal ,
	 were he Shakespeare himself ,
	 ad therefore he cannot prescribe either the ways or the aims for art .  The Possessed  looked for a long time like losing its way ,

	 tendentious ,
	 this was bound to be so .  And yet a novel doesn't write itself ,

	 or aesthetics ,
	 many do not in fact contain any art criticism ,

	 and putting new points of view .  When works of art are described only those aspects of an image important to the They may ,

	 as a colour plate which is readily available  ( perhaps having been used in another publication )  is much cheaper to use than a new plate which has to be commissioned .  The reader can thus be aware that a writer may have written round what happens to have been offered .  This may be important in assessing how well a writer illustrates an In all capitalist democracies there are two sources for the legitimacy of the state ,
	 namely statehood itself and the ideology specific to the state in question .  It will be argued that when the second source is threatened as well as the first ,
	 the power to coerce can devolve on the civil sphere in a substantive way .  The conclusion to the Covenant theology itself empowers the people to take action against the state in certain and specific circumstances ,
	 and Ian Paisley and many of his supporters both within and without the Orange order have frequently used bully - boy tactics ,
	 and approved paramilitary processions ,
	 marching ,
	 and drilling .  From Carson to Paisley one finds the argument that it is legitimate to fight to regain one's  fundamental freedom if the sovereign with whom one has  covenanted one's  allegiance betrays that allegiance and conducts one into slavery .  The Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it .  The members of his party appeared to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill ,
	 and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 .  When he was told of the hierarchy's opposition to any bill of this kind ,
	Dr Browne ,
	himself secularly inclined ,
	submitted his proposals and But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation .  In addition ,
	 the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships ,
	 doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues .  Part of the overall These last were soon replaced ,
	 on 9 May ,
	 by a more specific and highly organized pressure group headed by many who had previously mounted the Pro - Life Anti - abortion Campaign .  Of particular importance to the anti - divorce campaign was a lawyer ,
	 William Binchy ,
	 who had already produced a book in 1984 on the subject .  Large publicity campaigns began and the Irish Times also lent its weight to the pro - divorce This was the line already adopted by Binchy  ( 1984 )  who interpreted world - wide statistics in this direction .  Divorce was seen to be harder on the women than the men ,

In opposing the One might be forgiven for thinking that the bishops letter had something to do with it and that Haughey was intent on constructing an alliance between those heeding the teaching of the hierarchy and the party faithful .  In early May ,
	 two - thirds of Fianna Fil TDs from the West had already indicated they would campaign in their constituencies against the amendment  (  Irish Times  ,
	 2 May 1986 )  .  The Woods' speech also introduced an important new The main grounds appeared to be  the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages .  However ,

	 no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been produced .  Harry MacAdoo ,
	 then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin ,
	 on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions ,
	 and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .  When considering the merit of this In the debates over the last twenty years there has been considerable interplay of theological and sociological reasoning ,
	 with social scientists also contributing to papers and discussions .  What has been seen as an aspect of the Roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in Chapter 5 can also be recognized as a feature of the defence of catholic schools too :  the opposition contains an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happens to catholics who are not to some degree protected from it .  In this writer's view ,
	the Put together with a faith vision of the contemporary social world as inherently secularist and radically subversive of Roman catholic values ,
	 the combination is significantly reactionary and ethnocentric .  The aspects of this political theology will be discussed later .  First it is necessary to consider the Irish bishops have been well aware of Spencer's   ( 1968 )  research .  Using traditional measures of religiosity ,
	 he has pointed out the apparent failure of English catholic schools to produce better catholics and fewer ex - catholics than state or  other schools ,
	 and has inferred the likelihood of the same for Irish schools .  Spencer's In the light of W. McCready's  findings in another study that the religious behaviour of the father had a greater impact on children ,
	 Greeley considered the fact that catholic schools were having an increasing influence on men to be of significant importance for the future of Roman catholicism in the USA  ( 1976 :  1735 )  .  Clearly ,
	 the follow - up study was more favourable to the defenders of catholic schools than to opponents .  However ,
	Greeley and Rossi's work also has been used to uphold the defenders' There was nothing in the studies on the differences between individual catholic schools ,
	 either in terms of pupil experiences or the varieties of educational practice and personnel in each school .  A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .  Finally ,
	while it could be argued that Greeley and Rossi tell us something of catholic versus state schooling in the US ,
	they have nothing to tell us about catholic versus Christian ,
	multi - denominational schools ,
	which is what most of the A black - box approach to the schooling process was used with no direct investigation of processes within the schools .  Finally ,

	 one has to improve relationships within Northern Ireland without trying to merge the entire school system .  However ,
	 curricular changes ,
	 joint teaching projects ,
	 and overall greater contact were seen necessary .  Roman catholic church leaders have used additional local studies to refute They have interpreted Salters's  study of Belfast secondary schools as showing catholics to be less prejudiced than protestants .  Even if this were so ,
	 the implication has been made by catholic school supporters that catholic schools have not promoted or reinforced any measure of prejudice ,
	 and that no other possible type of school could improve on them  ( Daly 1975 )  .  Unfortunately ,
	the necessary link to warrant this second conclusion a control group of catholics in a multi - denominational situation was simply not available to Salters ,

	 the ethnographer has studied a social system or culture through a period of intensive participant observation in the field .  This has generated considerable concern about the ethnographic experience itself ,
	 and specifically about the subjective nature of the process .  Unlike the natural sciences ,

	the social sciences and increasingly anthropology have developed an elaborate As social dirt they become an affront to purity and possess the danger of the contagious and impure  ( Douglas 1966 )  ,

Much of our daily work was ten years in advance of the official police community involvement programmes and yet our actions were only an extension of those social welfare activities the police have been heavily involved in for generations ,
	 but which are never given status as real police work simply because of the institutional emphasis placed upon summons lists ,

	 killed by malaria and stomach trouble from their time in Bengal .  Menzies himself had a yellow face with a stained - looking flush on each cheekbone ,
	 and when he felt a bout of fever coming on ,
	 he drank to drown the symptoms .  Now he looked over at Cameron ,
	taking stock of the quizzical lift of his right eyebrow when he looked out below his black fringe ,
	the down - turn of his mouth under his long curved nose ,
	and began to recapitulate his He expected a few dozen people .  But the ranks and clusters of them stretched uncountably into the darkness .  He turned to James in amazement and saw that he was enjoying his surprise ,
	as though it confirmed one of his He let his words trail off .  They all went over to the fire for plates of meat and bread .  In his mind Cameron continued the With the weather holding .  There will be fewer to bring it in next year ,
	 when the listed men have gone .  Menzies brought out the familiar Yes ,
	 urged .  By a show of force ?  By reasoned I had to adopt  the aspect of receptivity .  I was very receptive to the Bible ,
	 authority .  I wasn't interested in Since these states of affairs are of the essence of human perceptual consciousness and ,
	 therefore ,
	 of the human mind ,
	 it must follow that there are non - physical states of affairs essential to the human mind .  So a materialist theory of the mind is false .  The most primitive physicalist response to this But this brings us back to the initial problem ,
	 which was precisely to explain how materialism could accommodate such a feel .  We cannot ,
	 therefore ,
	 leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical processes that they feel different .  In fact ,
	the mode of access It would make no sense to say that the dots in the picture had a Gestalt  of themselves ,
	 but to apply this model to the brain and experience would be just like that ;  for ,
	 if the experience just is  a state of the brain ,
	 then there is no way in which the character of the experience can be explained as the result of some perspective on  the brain .  Nor ,
	 more abstractedly ,
	 could it be the result of a perspective on the informational content of the brain ;  for ,
	 in either case ,
	 the perspective would have to be the occurrence of some further brain or informational state and to both of these the scientist has complete access ,
	 and the problem reoccurs .  If what I said above is correct ,
	failure of the mode of access First ,
	 an objector might try to press the fashionable distaste for the first - person perspective and say that the fact that I cannot apply the theory to myself shows nothing except that one should not approach the philosophy of mind via the first person .  A philosophical theory is essentially a reflection on a practice ,
	 and the first - person perspective expresses engagement in the practice :  to apply the theory first - personally is to confuse levels .  This is a spurious In showing that cognition as a whole cannot be treated behaviouristically ,
	 I have not thereby shown that a behaviouristic treatment of sense - experience is false .  So perhaps my overkill misses the target :  perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception is sound ,
	 even though a general behaviourism is not ,
	 and what BS lacks is not knowledge of the nature of certain mental states ,
	 but only the ability to respond spontaneously to visual stimuli ,
	 that is ,
	 to respond as a result of actually seeing them .  Reflection on the nature of the There are ,
	 though ,
	 a host of reasons for resisting any kind of equation between mental representations and mental pictures ;  and all of these derive from one fundamental reason .  Any mental picture will require interpretation ,
	 and this interpretation will be another mental operation ,
	 which ,
	 on the view that thinking is having mental pictures ,
	 will be another picture ,
	 which itself will require interpretation ,
	 and so on and so on .  This may look like an easy knock - down Well how do I know  that this computer does not have a theory of the external world ?  I have no argument ,
	 an objector would say ,
	 just a prejudice .  Well ,
	I think that there is an But this is a fairly repugnant conclusion to most of us .  Do we really want to say that all we ever learn we knew before  even if we are  saying this in some technical computational sense ?  How about a more modest version of the Constructivism and development The constructivist theory of mind regards thinking on an analogy with action ;  just as the representation theory takes an analogy with drawing and writing .  Moreover ,
	to the same extent that the representational theory is non - developmental ( recall the Fodor's So why not say ,
	 then ,
	 that in development perception teaches action ,
	 that as the information delivered up by the input systems becomes progressively richer the infant becomes better able to direct his own movements ,
	 rather than saying that cognisance develops out of action ?  My answer to this point will be more philosophical than empirical .  It will rely upon an Autism is a very profound cognitive deficit indeed ,
	 and everything that I have said up to now entails that a person whose thinking significantly lacks an holistic character ,
	 and lacks the related qualities of directedness ,
	 inhibition and co - ordination ,
	 will be profoundly affected .  Coda We have covered a lot of ground ,
	and maybe the path through the undergrowth of I How might such states be both mental and physical at the same time ?  We do not want to say that one kind of state causes the other kind ,
	 but neither does it make much sense to say that they are parallel or identical .  There are Most ,
	 perhaps all ,
	 functionalists are thorough - going materialists who believe that mental phenomena are genuine physical  phenomena seen at a particular level of abstraction .  This commitment to materialism means that a couple of standard dualist objections must be faced .  First ,
	there is the dualist's Furthermore ,
	 the work of Young and his colleagues ,
	 which I shall be discussing later in the chapter ,
	 shows that being aware of the operations of ,
	 say ,
	 one's  face processing system has vitally important functional consequences .  However ,
	 the functionalist view is that it would be quite misguided to attempt to explain behaviour by making direct reference to the subjective  or phenomenal  qualities  ( technically known as qualia  )  of these mental states .  If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content ( and see Dennett ,

	for some powerful If it is really necessary to think of mental states as having qualitative content  ( and see Dennett ,
	 1988 ,

	 then it follows from functionalism that such qualia do not have causal interactions with other mental states or behaviour and are mere epiphenomena .  Successful Science The sceptic might ,
	at this point ,
	complain that while I may have sketched out the functionalist position ,
	I have not provided any convincing This is the myth that I want to examine here .  Although the majority of scientists tend to be a little coy about metaphysical matters in their professional publications ,
	 they are often less so outside when writing elsewhere ,
	 being prone to describe the framework of presuppositions about perception within which they conduct their investigations as if it were a discovery in its own right and that discovery an explanation of perception .  And although the majority of materialist philosophers base their belief in the neurophysiological theory of perception on Moreover ,
	 rather as substance dualism tends to do ,
	 it seems to undermine the causal role of consciousness in ,
	 for example ,
	 bringing about or influencing actions .  For the causal relations of events would be just the same irrespective of whether or not the causal chain temporarily took on a mental aspect  ( as in property dualism )  or  ( as in substance dualism )  went mental for a while .  A further telling The monotony of the individual neurones is irrelevant ;  what matters is the infinite variety of their combinations ,
	 of their patterns ,
	 which will become evident when we look at the nervous system at the right level .  I shall deal with the language of neurophysiological description shortly .  However ,

	 written in a crusading spirit ,
	 without any critical distance ,
	 and it is informed ,
	 like Belsey's  book ,
	 by the assumption that language  or literature  can give us no certain knowledge of the world .  Hawkes's  polemical purpose becomes more and more apparent as the book develops :  it is to undermine ,
	 not only established literary study ,
	 but liberal humanism itself .  His As I have remarked ,
	 Culler's  Structuralist Poetics  encouraged some readers to think in terms of rapprochement  between the New and the Newer Criticism .  Anthony Easthope's  Poetry as Discourse  offers a complex blend of old and new .  He takes poststructuralist assumptions about the death of the author and the disappearance of the self - subsistent ego ,
	and applies them to the history of English poetry ,
	in a work which combines ingenious close reading ,
	impressive knowledge of metre ,

	 as Chris Baldick remarks in a review of Frederick Crews's  Skeptical Engagements  :  One lamentable practice which Crews rightly scorns is the increasingly revived trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempts to substantiate one's theoretical Interestingly ,
	 Anthony Easthope acknowledges the distinction at one point in Poetry as Discourse  :  Failure to distinguish clearly between signified and referent ,
	 the object it may refer to ,
	 has led to serious confusion in some accounts of the ideogram .  Yet it is a confusion he frequently falls into elsewhere ,
	 as do other New Accents writers .  Tallis's case is convincing ,
	though he has certainly not said the last word on the matter ,
	and there may well be further He did not intend to exclude  reality .  The error lies with Saussure's  expositors .  Scholes ,
	however ,
	believes that Saussure is himself inconsistent ,
	and responsible for later confusion ,
	but the thrust of his Some of this writing is acute and interesting ,
	 the product of lively minds with genuine insights into the state of contemporary culture .  I would often rather read it than more conventional forms of literary scholarship .  Yet it is frequently open to pragmatic self - refutation : it argues against reason by the processes of reason ,
	and a political cause ,

	 at best to be read only in historical terms ,
	 or subject to symptomatic readings ,
	 seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced .  Against this ,
	 Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary ,
	 and that they contain implicit images and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to .  This is an interestingly eclectic It is never very apparent what Freudian claims are based on ,
	 though they are widely accepted in our culture .  My scepticism has been reinforced by the recent work of Frederick Crews ,
	 who for many years was a leading psychoanalytic critic in America .  During the 1970s he began to lose faith in the whole Freudian programme ,
	and in his recent book ,
	Skeptical Engagements ,
	he provides detailed and substantially supported Nevertheless ,
	 Raymond Tallis ,
	 whose own training is in medicine ,
	 has shown to what extent one of Lacan's  key concepts ,
	 the importance of the mirror stage in the development of the infant's  sense of self ,
	 has no base in clinical experience .  As far as Tallis is concerned ,
	 Lacan is a charlatan ,
	 the L. Ron Hubbard of psychoanalysis .  Yet his system ,
	like others on the contemporary scene ,
	is constructed so as to repel Much of the work that is rediscovered may have the literary qualities that will satisfy readers without particular feminist interests :  the poems by women that Roger Lonsdale included in The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth - Century Verse  are a small - scale ,
	 easily accessible instance .  Nevertheless ,
	 in a feminist academic context writing may well be studied ,
	 not primarily for its literary but for its cultural interest .  This question provoked These phrases ,
	 and others like them ,
	 have been debated and pondered ,
	 interpreted and reinterpreted ,
	 as though they were the formulations of the great philosophers of the past ,
	 like Plato or Kant ,
	 rather than the work of a living thinker in mid - career .  There is a sense in which interpretation without conclusion is a mode of play ;  deconstruction insists that philosophical texts must be read as though they were literary texts ,
	 with full attention to their ambiguities and irresolutions .  In this light ,
	Anyone who can say so clearly just what Derrida is saying ,
	 or doing ,
	 immediately puts the reader in his debt .  Yet the clarity and rigour may in themselves be problematical .  This was the position argued some years ago by practitioners of la nouvelle critique ,
	who believed that clarity in In America fashion can actually be enforced .  A few years ago ,
	 as part of an annual round - up of critical books for Encounter  ,
	 I reviewed an interestingly speculative work on modern fiction by an American academic .  My feelings about the book were positive rather than the reverse ,
	but I complained in my review that it was studded with references to fashionable French gurus that were purely cosmetic ,
	adding nothing to the author's Marxists invoke History as a transcendent signified ,
	 the ultimate in terms of which everything else is to be explained ;  but there are many histories ,
	 not one ,
	 and we choose those which suit us .  As Edward Pechter puts it ,
	 History does not tell us what the text is ,
	 because we decide what history is ,
	 and then put history into the text ,
	 rather than the other way round .  Something similar is true of politics ,
	another transcendent signified and He believes that literary study has a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ;  and the implication of his recent work is that there are other ways of attaining cultural value .  This has some affinity with the Marxist position .  In a published Scholes is not a Marxist ,
	 but his American cultural populism has affinities with recent Marxist writing ;  at the same time ,
	 Hirsch and Scholes find themselves in unexpected agreement .  One might reach out to other affinities .  When Scholes writes that no text is so trivial as to be outside the bounds of humanistic study ,
	I am reminded of C. S. Lewis's Literariness is to be found as a basic principle in the work of the Russian Formalists and the New Critics ,
	 and ,
	 elaborately formulated ,
	 in Frye's  Anatomy of Criticism  .  It inevitably presents itself in formalistic terms ,
	 and sometimes in overtly aesthetic ones .  The latter presentation is not so common ,
	because of the generally unfavourable associations of aesthetic in our culture ,
	though it is implied whenever students are asked to approach a poem as a work of art ,
	rather than as an historical document or a philosophical Something of the sort has already been introduced into some English degrees ,

	 but the best literary journalism can provide genuine and valuable criticism ,
	 as Morris Dickstein has pointed out .  What is needed are more journals that are prepared to publish long ,
	 serious ,
	 reflective essays or review - articles ,
	 as the London Review of Books  does .  Victoria Glendinning ,
	writing as a biographer and literary journalist ,
	has offered some judicious thoughts on the question ,
	which summarize much of my Mr Noel Stock ,
	 who speaks as one who had Pound's  confidence in recent years and was in daily contact with him ,
	 explains that this passage derives from a hint thrown out by Jessie L. Weston in her from Ritual to Romance  ,
	 to the effect that the charges of heresy brought against the Templars were not wholly unfounded ,
	 since some of the practices of the Eleusinian mystery - cults from the pagan Near East survived in the heart of Christendom in the rituals of the Templars ,
	 a survival to be traced in literature in the stories and poems about the quest of the holy grail .  From Ritual to Romance  came out in 1920 ,
	 and was a new book when T.S. Eliot borrowed from it for The Waste Land ,
	thus making it permanently famous ; Pound could not have known of it in 1911 ,
	but if he had then visited the Templars' cavern - church in Aubeterre he could hardly have failed to remember it in the light of jessie Weston's The story is an intricate one ,
	 as Herbert Schneidau acknowledges ;  and Pound's  holding out against Ford for the Dantesque principle of a curial diction  ( see his introduction to the poems of Lionel Johnson )  represents to my mind an objection that can still be raised to Ford's  principles of diction ,
	 salutary as Ford's  polemics undoubtedly were for Pound at this time .  Moreover Prothero ,
	 a historian ,
	 perhaps had no ideas about poetic diction one way or the other ;  Pound ,
	 as we have seen ,
	 thought himself victimized by Prothero not for anything to do with writing but for having championed Lewis the painter and Gaudier the sculptor .  All the same Schneidau's If we resent this  ( as we should )  ,
	 we ought to realize that it is we who are to blame for it .  For neither Kenner nor Pound is a professional or obsessive Anglophobe .  Both men are reporting what seem to them the facts of the case ,
	and they are the more confident about doing so because no Englishman has arisen to rebut their All  his pride in his memory ,
	 his sense of the internationale of writers ,

	 musicians ,

	 as Yeats described his aim in the Cantos )  it is all a huge AESTHETICISM ,
	 ending in hate for Jews ,
	 Reds ,
	 change ,
	 the content and matter often of disaster ,
	 a loss of future ,
	 and in that a fatality as death - full as those for whom the atom bomb is Armageddon ,
	 not Apocalypse .  Again ,
	 Pound's  admirers will protest ;  and they will be right ,
	 insofar as  Yeats's  account of the Cantos  isn't so definitive as Olson takes it to be .  But the main thrust of Olson's An instance ,
	 and a momentous one ,
	 is Tate's  review in Poetry  for November 1932 ,
	 of Pound's  How To Read  :  The real criticism of Mr Pound is not to be directed against his theory as such ,
	 but rather at the hasty headlong fashion  in which he presents it ,
	 at the logical confusion of his intellect when it is not performing the task which is specifically his own ,
	 that task being poetry .  The justification of Mr Pound's thesis in How To Read is not his The choreography likewise evokes changes of weather and mood but without displaying any overt narrative development .  The two central ,
	 baggy - suited dancers ,

The deficit is created by the actions of the private sector .  If so his History shows it can go on for a long time ,

	 they will only do so at a lower price for sterling .  If you take the It is ,
	 he argues ,
	 not at all clear how you raise private savings to close the other kind of gap .  This point should not be pushed to perversity :  the IMF is still clear that a US - style deficit is worse ,

	 outlawing the joys of shitting and coprophilia ,
	 drove her to open the doors of the Stock Exchange ,
	 and end its exclusivity .  This would seem a benign effect of Thatcher's  bad potty training ,
	 except that Abse has a bee in his bonnet against gambling .  The second real objection to this form of psycho - biography is that as soon as Freud is quoted as gospel ,

	 when he arrived at Repton in 1918 ,
	 met a headmaster destined to play a far more important part in his life than is the fate of most headmasters .  Fisher was quick ,

	 capable .  He always saw straight to the point of an He had to recite from memory in front of his headmaster fifty Greek lines from the play Medea   a severe punishment ,
	 for learning fifty lines of verse in a language imperfectly known would take several hours of spare time .  The severity may have had a cause hidden from the young Ramsey .  just before he arrived at the school Victor Gollancz left its staff ,

	 that reason was not all of humanity .  The argument went on and on .  The elder was contemptuous when the younger replied to his crushing Michael's  problem was that he saw the glamour in Frank's  position :  the love of liberty ;  the excitement in the free pursuit of truth ;  the shaking off of convention and mere conformity ;  the feeling that religion was a stuffy valley out of which he had grown .  He also had to recognize that his brother was an unselfish person ;  so that the axiom ,
	 only religious people are unselfish did not wash .  The Nor did he find it awkward that the tutor's  rooms were immediately below his own in the Pepys building .  Evidently he did not expect to give riotous or alcoholic parties at times when the tutor might be in .  The undergraduates found him a leg - puller ,
	and a reveller in political He  dedicated this formidable intellect to eradicating nonsense from the world ,
	 especially nonsense in divinity ,
	 which was a world where in those days he could find plenty of targets for his scorn .  And in the faculty he was surrounded by several men of substance with much the same opinions though with less hardness in their advocacy .  Since most Christian teachers are kind persons who prefer to avoid controversy when they can ,

	 except by unofficial observers .  Therefore a man like Ramsey brought the This was a Churchill decaying physically ,
	 slower in the uptake ,
	 less able to work long hours ,
	 less interested in the peacetime problems of the country ,
	 but still well enough to make his own decisions .  He had an archbishop ,

	 with a good judgement of men and with a lot of information about them .  So the discussion ,

Two other circumstances entered this prolonged Some of these canons were still observed  ( what to wear when conducting morning prayer )  and some were long obsolete  ( rules about clergy nightcaps or yellow stockings on their legs )  .  It therefore occurred to the canon lawyers  a rarefied group of experts  that Church law ,
	 framed by the Church organs and then approved by the sovereign ,
	 could achieve the canons which would bind consciences .  Archbishop Fisher accepted the If one is partly responsible already for the general policy of a Church or for anything else ,
	 it is better to be more responsible .  It puzzled him into the New Year of 1961 that no one asked his opinion .  Five years before ,
	Fisher drew him into the Macmillan talked to Sir Henry Willink ,

	 one wonders ,
	 how could there constantly be those asides ,
	 which seem to reveal that the participants were actually aware the game was up or rather perhaps had never started ?  One of the lessons to be drawn from the study of early - twentieth - century imperialism is the extraordinary durability of policies and programmes which lack all possibility of being realised .  The remarkable thing about political houses built on sand ,
	or castles in the air ,
	is how long they often take to collapse ; and this very time - lag becomes an In front of a consequence so stark the deepest political thinkers recoiled .  In the noble eloquence of his plea for conciliation with the colonists ,
	 Burke ,
	 who based his case on the proposition that they had not been represented at Westminster ,
	 drew a strange and illogical conclusion .  His own Tape every rehearsal on a portastudio or cassette machine ,

	 however remote ,
	 may be crucial .  The He relates this to the state of culture of his own age ,
	 facing dangers of over - specialization ,
	 which impoverishes both the religious and artistic sensibilities by separating each from the other ,
	 so that only the vestige of manners  may be left for those who ,
	 having their sensibility uninformed either by religion or by art ,
	 have nothing left but an inherited behaviour which ceases to have meaning .  Eliot had written of and against such a milieu  when he combined the elements of the savage and the city ,
	 from the beating tom - tom of Portrait of a Lady through the rituals of The Waste Land  and Sweeney Agonistes  to the cocktail chatter and jungle martyrdom of the play ,
	 The Cocktail Party  ,
	 yet to come .  Revising the original articles for Notes towards the Definition of Culture ,
	he complicated his I have in mind two  especially :  the first involves what might be called the impossibility of desire ,
	 the second the notion of desire and/or identity as involving an ineluctable splitting .  Like other key notions in psychoanalysis ,
	 the sense of desire as a quest for an always impossible self - completion in or through the other has a long though oft en unrecognized history .  In this case Kaja Silverman has usefully remarked the importance ,
	for Jacques Lacan's version of this In The Masculine Dilemma   ( 1980 )  ,
	 subtitled A Psychology of Masculinity ,
	 Gregory Rochlin offers a different version of the homosexual male ,
	 but one which is once again in the service of defending an updated heterosexual masculinity ,
	 and its primacy within a sexual difference metaphysic .  Drawing on psychoanalysis ,
	 Rochlin rewrites masculinity in a way which makes a virtue of what was hitherto thought of as ,
	 or experienced as ,
	 a defect :  its much remarked insecurity .  His The metaphysical construction of subjectivity is at once an admission and production of its disruptive potential ,
	 a disruption in and of the very terms of its construction .  It also suggests ,
	 paradoxically ,
	  that the less autonomous individuality is thought to be ,
	 the more it might be marked by a potentially subversive agency .  But this is to anticipate the In a letter of 25 January 1620 Sir John Chamberlain remarks a very significant event in the contemporary cross - dressing controversy :  James I's  instruction to the clergy to suppress women doing it .  The king is reported as having told the clergy that they must reproach the practice vehemently and bitterly ,
	 and if this did not succeed ,
	 he would take further measures .  Chamberlain refers to this in the same breath as mentioning an Even so his mother was appalled ;  she thought that the desert and solitude had turned my brain'  ( p. 293 )  .  She told him that he would cover himself with ridicule by bringing the boy back .  After much But these largely managerial changes hardly amounted to a fundamental review ;  rather they were concerned to promote competition and value for money .  Over time the rhetoric of government spokesmen has changed to boasting of how much more manpower  ( doctors and nurses )  and money is devoted to the NHS ,
	 compared to 1979 .  The government's early On the one hand ,
	 a private sector which allowed free entry of producers ,

	 and pre - empting investment funds from more productive areas .  Since 1979 the programme of privatization has been defended with a mixture of ideological and pragmatic In public and private she is a relentless educator .  An important task of leadership ,
	 in her view ,
	 is to win the battle of ideas ,
	 and this is done by frequently expressing basic beliefs and principles .  She seems to revel in ( Former schoolfriends recall an occasion when Mrs Thatcher ,

As Prime Minister I could not waste time having any internal The so - called wets favoured an interventionist role for government in the economy and were prepared to increase state spending to boost employment ,

So it was without surprise that he found himself sharing with her one of the tinny ,

As soon as the linked train of little open cars began its steeply angled ascent she clutched the Finnish detective by the It was an exclamation she might have had to clarify .

It simply means that you have frozen on the airbrake lever and have undershot when you could have saved the situation .  This is the same as throttle Such special knowledge holds further difficulties ,
	 for it highlights the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account  of such an institution ,
	 bringing to the forefront those expectations of loyalty which the executive demands of any individual who has hold of the account .  Ethical problems will surface ,
	 for no power - based organization likes to have its idiosyncrasies made public ,
	 and the anthropologist who is a member of the family and not merely a temporary visitor to the backyard exotica can find that writing anything at all becomes crucially problematic .  Expectations of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reaching fruition ,

	 largely to demonstrate cost effectiveness in line with criteria imposed by the limits on public spending  ( HO Circular 114/83 )  and the prevalent socio - economic world view of society .  This has meant that many studies tend to concentrate on the objective assessment of a fiscally quantifiable reality .  For example ,

	 who is to be controlled by whom and for what reasons ?  Meanwhile ,
	 as Reiner  ( 1985 )  suggests ,
	 the politicization of the police has proceeded at a pace ,
	 and can be illustrated by their growing willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy .  This trend is further displayed in their growing tendency to agree to be used as a pseudo - military Not Jay .  I have been savaged  by love ,

	 if the referee points his fingers this indicates that someone had done something wrong .  If he extends his Even during flurries of techniques ,
	 both hands remain on their respective sides of the centre - line .  Arm movement Economy of Follow the opponent's  shape ,
	 not his attacking limb ,
	 because although an individual technique may have been successfully evaded ,
	 the opponent still remains potentially dangerous .   Scoop the opponent's  front kick ,
	 drawing it back and up to break his balance If you are likely to face his open side ,
	then circle your blocking The third example uses a short but wide diagonal movement of the front foot to take you clear of the opponent's  incoming reverse punch .  Use a long ,
	 thrusting snap punch to the opponent's  face and if the chance presents itself ,
	 follow up quickly with a reverse punch .  If the opponent's attack is a face punch ,
	then hit his extended The second requirement is that of good timing .  Some competitors just aren't quick enough off the mark ,
	 or they hold back instead of thrusting in strongly .  Either of these faults means that the attacking technique is well developed before you move into it ,
	and so your front barring To do this you slide back your rear foot so that the stance lengthens  ( this makes it more stable in a longitudinal direction )  and your centre of gravity drops .  If the action is sharp enough your opponent's  punch will graze over the top of your head ,
	 helped on its way by a fast rising block .  As well as dealing with the punch ,
	the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent ,
	catching him high on the attacking As well as dealing with the punch ,
	 the rising block travels diagonally up and forwards into the opponent ,
	 catching him high on the attacking arm .  Do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring your chin close to the opponent's  other fist .  There is no need to withdraw your blocking  shout to underline your score .  Drop under the opponent's high punch ,
	blocking high on his Even if the slide is not feasible ,
	 you can still throw your centre of gravity forward ,
	 so that weight increases on the leading leg .  The fifth attention - grabber is the exaggerated hip action which should accompany every punch .  This shows that the punch is not merely an The back fist This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one .  The back fist unrolls from the shoulder ,
	propelled as much by the body turning away as by the This punch is not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one .  The back fist unrolls from the shoulder ,
	 propelled as much by the body turning away as by the arm action itself .  Many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,
	 and raise your other hand as a guard .  Unfortunately ,
	 the cocking action that begins a back fist movement presents an unmistakable cue to the opponent .  The punching elbow must be flexed before it can be extended fully ,
	and any attempt to strike with a semi - extended Also ,
	 the opponent may fall in an unexpected direction ,
	 so that you have to spin around and perhaps take a step to reach him. By that time ,
	 of course ,
	 the element of surprise is lost and his guard is ready and waiting .  The remainder of the sequence then degenerates into a mle of pumping If they took a whirl at the minister ,

The restoration work has brought to light tricks of the Gibbons trade .  As they lie on the benches within In following Stravinsky's  guidelines ,
	 Ashton found many new ,
	 sometimes frivolous ,
	 ways of performing class - room steps .  The corps de ballet  neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur les pointes  ,
	 raising the working knee and resting the toe on the calf of the other leg ,
	 before moving forwards .  They travel forwards instead of en place in chapp relevs after breaking the rule that the Dancers easily understand how a series of swift pas de bourre courus   ( i.e. running on the toes )  as danced by the Queen of the Wilis in Giselle  ,
	 differs from the same step performed piqu   ( i.e. each foot picked up sharply at each change of weight )  ,
	 as in many of petipa's  solos .  But it is not always easy to decide which is the more appropriate ,
	 nor how the two ways mentioned can lead to other versions .  for example ,
	in her solo in Ashton's Cinderella the Winter Fairy moves across the stage in a series of pas de bourre en tournant terre ,
	the feet weaving their in - and - out pattern as the In Symphonic  Variations  ,
	 the dancers perform pas de bourre piqus sur les pointes  very gently because they are marking the rhythmic beat as the soloist dances to the melodic phrase .  This is an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythms are explicitly brought to life by the dance design  ( see page 68 )  .  One of the most beautiful uses of pas de bourre courus is when Ashton places his danseuse in her partner's But such jumps can also travel some way forwards ,
	 backwards or sideways and can become sparklingly light when the knees are sharply bent upwards at the height of the jump .  This is required of the Four Fairies ,
	 the Fairy Godmother and the Stars in Ashton's  Cinderella  .  However if this way of jumping from two feet to two feet had not been combined with well picked - up pas de bourre piqus and relevs retirs as well as extremely accurate ,
	quick ports de bras with straighter and more angled than rounded It can be that magic moment in such dances as the Rose Adage in The  Sleeping Beauty  when Aurora triumphantly raises her hand from the fourth Prince's  grasp and holds the final attitude  for several seconds revealing her complete command over the forces of gravity .  There are hundreds of instances of this kind of pose created by many different choreographers .  There is the moment in the Act II pas de deux or Swan Lake where Odette appears to fly away in an arabesque before Siegfried seizes her For example  :  in Choros  he focuses attention on many ancient Greek dance rituals and accents the playful use of movement whilst at the same time showing that such warlike ,
	 athletic courtship and other activities are a wonderful game to be played by the performers .  In Consort Lessons  these quick changes of aulement  give much greater variety and dimension to the overall design particularly where the solo girl dances with four boys .  More recently ,
	in his The Sons of Horus he has found ways of incorporating the profiled attitudes and poses seen in ancient Egyptian designs with straight turned - in legs ,
	elongated lines and angled Petipa's  remark that without ports de bras  the dancer is dumb is only one of the wise comments he made when working on his choreographic designs .  Fokine echoed this remark when he said every step and pose is a gesture  ( see page 58 )  .  De Valois summed up the ideas of these two great choreographers by saying : Only synchronisation of This is particularly noticeable in his variations for the Six fairies in The Sleeping Beauty  .  Petipa clearly reflects in dance the gift that each fairy brings to the Christening .  The first Fairy is slow and gracious to denote Beauty ; she encircles her face with her hand and displays the line of her But if Ashton had not made these very distinctive changes in his ports de bras  ,
	 the seasonal differences would not have been so notable .  The above examples are only a few of those showing how conventional ports de  bras  can be changed .  A study of Ashton's ways of using them ,

	 moods and emotions of the characters their dancers are portraying .  Arms flick to and fro as the Winter Fairy and the Stars of Ashton's  Cinderella  give the illusion of twinkling lights in the frosty air .  The poignant shaking of the hands above upraised heads followed by the pressing downwards ,
	outwards and then backwards of the Any untoward or awkward transition is immediately noticeable because it destroys the calm dignity that the human body needs if it is to be shown at its best .  This does not mean that speed must be avoided ,
	 nor that the unexpected need offend the eye .  A sudden change of aulement ,
	an unusual turn in - out of legs or Later the mass of dancers merely moves upstage sur les pointes  to a pose and further ports de  bras  ,
	 then returns downstage to another slowly unfolding set of ports de bras  and arabesques  .  It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .  Before this the slowmoving dancers in their wide spreading tutus and veiled The demi - caractre  style has its roots in classical technique ,
	 but must be coloured by more clearly defined and individual movements which allow the dancers to show they are playing the part of some character who has some claim to live in the real world and therefore can be recognised as such .  In other words they usually ,
	 dance classically from their feet to the waist and above that are free to express themselves as people of more definite behaviour ,

	 peasants and the like the heroes and heroines of his ballets was beneath the dignity of an opera house whose stage had hitherto been occupied with the deeds of noble heroes ,
	 heroines and courts .  Bournonville coloured his ballets with movements characteristic of many different personalities and nationalities .  In his particular style of demi - caractre dance he used classical footwork for most of the time but ,
	from the waist upwards through the body ,
	But by the time Fokine produced The Firebird  he had developed his mimed dance much further .  It had become the most important part of his choreography .  His Firebird flew and still flies in all her glory before being trapped pitifully in the As traditional Italian dances are often sung ,
	 the performers pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase .  This was a feature widely used by nineteenth - century Italian balletmasters and by Bournonville .  But the latter's pause was often to hold the dancers in perfect 5th positions of both Spanish style  The stereotyped Spanish style is possibly seen at its best in Petipa's  Don Quixote  ,
	 most particularly in the famous pas de deux  fur the ballerina and her partner .  The tone is set by the continual use of the pose with head held high ,
	back slightly arched ,
	The working leg is thrust outwards on the first beat of a bar ,
	 heels click and stamp to accent the appropriate beats .  Although the solo danseuses  perform sur les pointes  ,
	 they still mark the appropriate beats by stabbing their toes into the floor ,
	 i.e. they dance a series of retirs passs  forwards or backwards without descending and use typical Hungarian ports de bras  .  These are also strongly accented as the This made the dancers appear as if they were a moving frieze .  Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus   ( 1985 )  .  Ashton too has created two oriental styled ballets in which the delicacy of the hands and It also conveys the mood and emotions of the Girl ,
	 a very rare happening in true folk dance .  The participants in folk dance can and certainly do show elation .  In La Fille Mal Garde Mother Simone does this when she triumphantly finishes her Clog Dance on the Fokine's  advice to those wishing to create the romantic style of dance was much as fur demi - caractre  when he said :  The choreographer should base his design on classical technique from the feet to the waist ,
	 but above that the dancer's  head ,
	 body and arms must be free to express the moods ,
	 emotions and actions of the character in the story or theme to be communicated .  This style was first created by Taglioni for his daughter Marie .  The tale of La Sylphide gave him an opportunity to exploit her expressive Ondine ,
	 the sea nymph  ( Margot Fonteyn )  so used her feet that she appeared always to float through water .  This was done by a series of pas marchs  each of which softly rose and fell through her feet from toe to heel .  They were co - ordinated with a soft undulating movement of the He stood silent and still ,
	 watching the tragedy of the Poor Girl who was being rejected by the Rich Man .  His two tiny gestures said everything and expressed the audience's  understanding of the plot .  He made one as if he should try and comfort her ,
	but turned away ,
	walked upstage and on the balcony with his back to the audience ,
	raised his The latter's  vicious slap on the child's  face explains more than any other gesture Natalia's  selfishness .  Yet the Tutor's  capitulation to Natalia reveals her power over every man she meets as well as his failure to withstand her wiles .  Ashton's careful build - up to this climax makes Vera's discovery of them in each other's If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan ,
	 they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture .  They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement .  It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body ,
	Yet if the dances of Vera and Natalia in A Month in the Country  and Juliet in Romeo and Juliet  are examined it will be discovered how the technical content is so designed that the steps ,
	 poses and gestures show how changing circumstances are affecting the individuals .  This is what Perrot first attempted with his five leitmotifs for Giselle   ( see page 61 )  .  Continual development in the choreographic design is very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the Tutor takes Natalia in his Juliet then becomes the slightly apprehensive debutante at the Ball where her movements ,
	 though tentative ,
	  are conventionally correct when she dances with Paris .  The moment she encounters Romeo and senses somehow that her life has changed her movement becomes more purposeful .  From there onwards it becomes stronger and more emotional so that her joyous movements and later abandon in Romeo's In the same way as conventional gesture  ( see page 88 )  ,
	 it has its rules which were formulated by John Davies in Orchestra ,

	 Nijinska gives both dancers and audience time to consider what has been done and what is yet to happen .  The nature of the formal shapes made by the dancers'  bodies and limbs as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluated .  Nijinska insisted on the use of the pointes in order to emphasise the elongated portraits of the Byzantine Saints ,

	 both historical and contemporary ,
	 for by doing so you will certainly set yourself up well for both drama school training and your subsequent acting career .    Approach to drama training One of the questions you may be Undoubtedly one of the best ways the overseas student has of seeing what is required in British theatre training is to apply for one of the summer schools offered by the drama schools ,
	 and find out what it's  all about before committing him -  or herself to a long and expensive stay .  It's  important that a student is prepared to understand and work with the prevalent theatrical traditions in UK schools .  And with so much theatre training available in the United States ,
	New Zealand ,
	Australia and Canada ,
	it is interesting to On obtaining a prospectus and asking for an application form ,
	 you will find that every drama school will require an audition fee ,
	 and this can vary between 15 and 25 .  If you can afford to ,
	 it's  generally best to spread your auditions around the drama schools so that you are seen more than once .  When auditioning for most schools you will be No drama school panel is looking for the ultimate in audition technique but candidates  should possess a noticeable degree of competence and self - awareness .  Not all auditions have just two speeches ,
	 classical and modern .  You may well be Pause Comment No particular accent is The new student does not perform to audiences immediately ,
	 and the first term's  production project will probably only be attended by staff teaching voice ,
	 movement and acting to enable individual assessments to be made on training .  Improvisation There have been many books written about improvisation and if I were Nowadays ,
	 nearly every young person has probably had some experience of basic improvisation at their school or through the extensive TIE  ( Theatre in Education )  tours .  In drama schools ,
	 improvisation is about finding a way of expanding the imagination and liberating the senses ,
	 which can get too confined if students work entirely from a text all the time .  The use of impro in training has gone through many phases ; it still conjures up the traditional ,
	hackneyed image of a student being The use of impro in training has gone through many phases ;  it still conjures up the traditional ,
	 hackneyed image of a student being asked to be a tree or an icecream .  But it's  possible to go way beyond these limited ,
	 obvious exercises ,
	 and impro can be immensely exciting for young actors ,
	 allowing them to grasp situations and emotions imaginatively ,
	 perhaps for the first time .  Here is an example of an impro exercise for two actors : An actor is What an impro of this kind does is confront the actors with a situation where they have to be emotionally truthful .  Without a text to assist them they may prevaricate too long before facing the brutal truth .  Improvisation can mean having the guts to experience anything which is Learn lines accurately  and always carry a pencil with you .  3 If you have a question about acting ,
	think about it before you Drama school productions are staged with an awareness of the kind of demands the profession will make ,
	 and students are naturally anxious to be seen in the final production by people who're likely to offer them work .  Unfortunately ,
	 it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of schedule ,
	which means agents are Well ,

	 but only with the intention of making an important point .  In 1985 Cox's paper was timely and We will see that this mode of constructing monopoly catholicism is alien to the Concordat period of Roman catholic church  state relations recognizable in arrangements ,
	 for example ,
	 with Spain ,
	 Portugal ,
	 and Italy .  A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church  state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville's   ( 1957 )  conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 .

I kept They had become my friends and there was no way that I would now go back to being their problem dependant .  I wandered back north towards the church .

A gentleman from Peebles called our phone - in to The most common cause of serious accidents on wire launches is making a snap decision to turn off for a 360 turn without ensuring that there is enough speed .  Even though the nose has been lowered well below the horizon ,
	 a glider takes time to regain speed ,
	 and any attempt to turn off immediately results in a potential stall and spin accident .  The first question you At an unfamiliar site ,

	One slip may mean that the wingtip is dropped ,
	 causing some very expensive damage to the wing or the fuselage structure and fittings .  It is rarely an impossibility to find a third person ,
	 and in gusty weather this must make sense .  Think how often you see two people struggling to rig or de - rig because they are too embarrassed or independent to Cockpit checks There was a time when many gliding instructors scorned the use of a rigid drill ,
	 and taught their students instead to check everything logically by going round the cockpit from left to right .  The disadvantage of this method is easily demonstrated by The pilot released the cable but could not keep the glider straight ,
	 or stop in time to prevent the collision .  The Nimbus was undamaged but the K8 had one wing severed at about half - span as well as other serious damage .  Realising that the take - off would involve an element of risk ,
	the Nimbus pilot had ,
	in fact ,
	refused to go at first ,
	and had In this position it will not leave the ground until a little more speed is gained .  The control movements needed to achieve this vary according to the configuration of the undercarriage .  Thus the pilots who are flying several different types of glider ,

	 any analysis of how that power is maintained  and used must be uncomfortable ;  while the insider had no means of retreating across some geographic boundary or vanishing like the traditional anthropologist ,
	 back into academia .  The researcher who is really at home as one of the natives must seek inside himself to create his remote areas  ( E. Ardener 1987 )  .  He must ,
	as Ardener demonstrates ,
	seek to sow semantic grain and grow theoretical crystals which he may well appreciate no one is Statistically these deaths largely occur as a result of the inhalation of vomit and alcoholic poisoning ,
	 and it therefore seems somewhat bizarre for the police to be in charge of those suffering in such a way .  More often than not the victims have serious medical problems ,
	 show a long history of social inadequacy ,
	 or are clearly suffering from mental illness .  At the 1987 annual ACPO conference ,
	chief officers complained they were still having to deal with this illness and As a working detective ,
	 it would take six months of living with a mate to trust him and know that when it came to the Crown Court appearance he would know exactly what to say .  ( From fieldnotes .  )  This distrust of the social scientist is so deeply ingrained that when I was reading anthropology as an undergraduate and I was I had applied to continue full - time research following my degree course ,
	 but this had been turned down by my chief officers ;  however ,
	 I had been told that assistance for part - time study would almost certainly be approved in view of the national policy of encouraging officers to extend their educational qualifications .  I then found my application for financial assistance for part - time study had been rejected because anthropology is not on the approved list of subjects  ( in the Circular )   ( Memo from HQ 1977 )  .  Eventually I was able to convince my senior officers that anthropology was one of the social sciences ,
	perhaps only because I somewhat sardonically returned a memo which Just over a year later ,
	 at a Career Appraisal Interview with the chief constable ,
	 I was asked :  tell me ,
	 how did you find the law course at the polytechnic ?  I pointed out that I had not been to the polytechnic ,
	 but had been to Durham University on a scholarship  only the second the force had been awarded .  I was then It would ,
	 of course ,
	 have revealed some aspects of the variable world of police culture to the outside and this was unacceptable .  Another writer on the police met similar problems when he wished to write and publish .  I had discussed the problems of insider analysis with him at a 1988 Police Conference ,
	where he described how ,
	on return to his force after his undergraduate degree ,
	he had The creation of this order at the time a new Official Secrets Bill was being pushed through Parliament by an increasingly interventionist government is significant ,
	 and the idea of a senior officer's  having first read of any essay to maintain the integrity of the institution manifests the importance of the legalized surveillance of allegedly dangerous material and enhances the separation of the world of control from that academic enquiry ;  although its implementation is only randomly applied .  Just as Sgt Wilson's  thesis was channelled to me because I was known to be interested in research ,
	 so many police research departments now get allocated the task of reading the essays submitted by sergeants and inspectors for NEBS or DMS qualifications .  In 1988 a visiting colleague from the Royal Ulster Constabulary Silence continues to sustain the hegemony ,
	 and social change only occurs when irresistible and more powerful forces are brought to bear from outside  ( see Adams 1988 )  .  Furthermore ,

	 between those who have material property and power and those who labour and are dispossessed .  Whether there is any social morality or justice in such a system is not a matter which the detectives are given to question ;  nor do  they spend much time in reflecting on why some dubious property acquisition is outside their terms of reference ,
	 or what the relationship is of such practices to the maintenance of position and power .  In the main ,

	alterations were more often than not effected with some degree of sympathy for the existing fabric and The ascetic modernists'  rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .  This attitude was amply revealed in the results of the competition  ( Inside the Pub )  launched jointly by The Architectural Review   and The Brewers'  Society in 1949 .

Many of the interiors created by the designers of such facilities are as forbidding as the old - fashioned spit - and - sawdust pub ; any lingering Much needs to be done .

	 Constant Lambert   and John Lanchbery .  All made valuable scores from existing music for de Valois ,
	 Ashton and MacMillan .  Not all the results were of the same high quality ; nevertheless the music they arranged reinforced the choreographer's design by giving the plot It is in contrast to another leitmotif that marks the entrances of Carabosse ,

	 they should use or create a style of movement appropriate to and expressive of the characters in the story being told and their moods ,
	 emotions and actions .  The dancers or players in a theme ballet will need to convey the general ( See also page 41 .  )  Rhythm in ballet is not therefore a mere time - keeper as it is in such social ballroom dances as waltzes and fox - trots .  A ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which sets the 3 Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,
	 they should be discussed with the composer or arranger of music whose first task may be to create a proper beginning with the overture .  Is it to set the general Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,
	 where the only thing amiss is Natalia's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because ,
	by creating and stressing the general the secular ,
	 moral and emotional behaviour of characters found in rural or urban communities ;  Secondly the traditional dances and customs of a particular country that can give local colour and They are also part of certain styles of Indian dance where gestures are explicit in conveying the beauty of the world ,
	 of women and of  -  love .  In such dances physical contact between lovers rarely if ever takes place .  Ashton broke this all - but - written law and communicated the exotic Even such mundane tasks as eating or drinking have found a place in some ballets .  Because on the stage they acquire importance ,
	 they must be seen to have a proper purpose .  This is usually to throw light on the character being played or to create the right The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods ,
	 emotions and actions of the characters they play .  This is what happens in MacMillan's  Romeo and Juliet  and Ashton's  A Month in the Country  .  It is perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwrights require pages of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot ,
	to create a changing Massine's  brilliant use of descriptive and narrative gestures in The Three - Cornered  Hat  was a proper development of Fokine's  mimed dance and danced mime ,
	 first seen in The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  As already noted ,
	 the dances Fokine staged for the nursemaids ,
	 coachmen and others at the Fair were real dances  ( see page 59 )  .  They created the Yet this work was absolutely contemporary when produced .  The three boys come directly from a battleship when they pick up three girls from the street .  The dancing reflects the wartime The group activities ensure that each phase of the ceremony is performed according to tradition .  The design emphasises the importance of creating a style which will define not only the time ,
	 place and action ,
	 but also the characters portrayed .  The technical or general style creates the structure and It is the very particular choreographic style that MacMillan created for the child - like figure in Requiem  that emphasises more strongly than any other of today's  ballets the need for choreographers to explore dance itself .  Only when they have examined what hands ,
	 arms ,
	 legs and feet ,
	 body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story ,
	 theme or music ,
	 can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture ,
	 with the right quality ,
	 mood ,
	 emotion ,
	 action and character .  The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and ,
	when needed ,
	help to create the While we must support family rooms in those pubs which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angels ,
	 this cannot remain the only answer to the problem .  Family rooms are useful to let the less well - behaved and noisier children run riot but they are frequently cold and characterless and ,
	 no matter how good the facilities may be ,
	 you often feel excluded from the main atmosphere of the pub .  I WOULD rather take my children into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect them to sit sensibly and reasonably quietly so that we can all relax ,

	 MacMillan's  Requiem  or Bintley's  Consort Lessons   students spend more time loosening up to meet the demands of modern choreographers .  There is often a rush to create something new without enough thought being given to the physical problems they may cause .  There remain ,
	however ,
	a few dancers who excel in the purely classical roles ,
	which an takes place during a particular period and in a particular environment .  These two requirements were first established by Greek playwrights and were later codified by the Acadmie Franaise  ( 1635 )  when it laid down rules for the composition of any literary work .  The rules are still valid and the libretto of any ballet neglecting them often fails to hold the attention of its Most other story ballets can be analysed in much the same way .  Those with a theme ,
	 or which consist of dance only ,
	 have a similar plan .  A choreographer who neglects the old rules and any item pertinent to the unfolding of the plot ,
	theme or music is demanding a great deal from an This can be effected by the use of a leitmotif or phrases of music .  Since the first performance of Giselle  ,
	 certain composers and arrangers have used leitmotifs fur one or several characters and repeat the leitmotifs each time the characters appear .  These musical phrases give continuity to the action and are most valuable because they help both performers and When petrushka is left alone in his room ,
	 his cries dominate the stage both musically and choreographically because the incessant throb is not heard .  So when the cry is heard again just before the curtain falls it comes as a final appeal for help .  There is always a moment of silence before the Fokine was the first choreographer to distinguish the need for a particular style for each ballet when he created such different ballets as Les Sylphides ,
	 Le Carnaval  ,
	 Prince Igor ,
	 The Firebird  and Petrushka  .  From his innovations have come many developments opening the way for similar independently minded choreographers .  They also opened the eyes of the Choreographers can also take a more subjective view of their work .  This is equally important and has so proved throughout ballet history .  The choreographer seizes on the personality of a particular dancer and creates ballets through which the dancer gradually develops and discloses unique talent and qualities to such a degree that No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,
	 both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who produces ballets which give A ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which sets the atmosphere ,

	 except perhaps in those cases where a poem is being interpreted  ( see page 28 )  .  Choreographers should never assume that all in the Shakespeare's  dramas of Hamlet ,
	 Romeo and Juliet  and Othello  have many subtle touches of humour and tenderness ,
	 as do his lighter works such as A Midsummer  Night's  Dream  .  All have been translated into successful choreographic form .  Similarly the delicate and subtle nuances of such ballets as Ashton's A Month in the Country ,
	Robbins' Dances at a Gathering and MacMillan's Song of the Earth are successfully conveyed and capture the Once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have been decided ,

	Prokofiev used his overture to Romeo and Juliet to introduce the leitmotifs which will help both dancers and Despite the general activities there is menace in the air and it is not long before the rival factions of Montagues and Capulets are fighting and deaths occurring before the lovers even meet .  This opening is very different from the quietly charming first scene of A Month in the Country  ,
	 where the only thing amiss is Natalia's  bored behaviour .  Even with such examples in mind the choreographer may well decide it is better to delay the confrontation between the chief players because ,
	by creating and stressing the general atmosphere ,
	this raises the Despite the great differences in style between the above three ballets and despite their different libretti the three choreographers perrot  ( with Saint - Georges )  ,
	 MacMillan and Ashton give valid reasons why the tragic deaths of Giselle ,
	 Romeo and Juliet ,
	 and Natalia's  lost love are the inevitable result of what has gone before .  In other words ,
	 what happens at the beginning of the story states why the relationships between two or more characters lead to confrontations which continue onwards to a climax and finally draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion .

	there are also the courtesies that must be shown to the bystanders on stage during a pas de deux so that such reciprocation can help to focus the It is equally important when she is wearing a soft tunic or one - piece tights and leotard .  The lines made by the two dancers together must always have room to breathe and to be seen separately if the whole design is to flow .  It is possibly the spaciousness of design that brings A contradiction in style during this change of aulement  or alignment can distort the design .  Nevertheless an unusual change of aulement  or alignment can add interest and draw attention to a dancer's  statement .  for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which Odile makes facing the Birthday Offering  Ashton's  technical virtuosity  ( The Royal Ballet )  Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers'  behaviour will appear more spontaneous and natural .  For example : each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers'  behaviour will appear more spontaneous and natural .  For example :  each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the audience ,
	 nor end with another bow or considered pose ;  but such behaviour may be included if the choreographer wishes to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfolds .  Many new members of an This last convention is invaluable in early training because it helps to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and is also valuable in such ballets as Birthday Offering  as it echoes the period and style of Glazounov's  music .  But this would get very boring if used too often .  Another old rule decreed that dancers never turned their backs on the A sudden change of aulement  ,
	 an unusual turn in - out of legs or arms ,
	 or quick jumps up and then down to the floor followed by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement has in the whole design .  Swift changes in the dimensions covered in any linear design are nowhere more obvious than in Ashton's  five abstract ballets and his example is now being followed by David Bintley in his Choros  and Consort Lessons  .  In fact such unusual movements often arouse the It should be noted that a similar order of precedence exists in Ashton's  Scnes de Ballet  as in Petipa's  The Sleeping Beauty  which was supposed to be an evocation of a court ballet at the time of Louis XIV .  However ,
	 when ballets were performed for the public ,
	 professional dancers took the place of courtiers and technical innovations had to be made .  The dancers now appeared on a stage before a wide It is when this mass of dancers divides and moves to the sides that the open space available for dancing is exposed fur the first time .

He explained the gestures in the libretto he prepared for his As a Greek and Latin scholar he had found them described in the works of ancient authors who wrote about the moods ,
	 emotions and actions of all the actors involved in their dramas .  By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members   of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who produced mime plays .  In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by Bratfisch attempts to entertain the doomed couple at the last meeting before their death and his sorrow as he comes to the graveside of the murdered .  heroine are an object lesson in understatement .  So explicit are the tiny gestures and the perfect timing of exits and entrances that the So explicit are the tiny gestures and the perfect timing of exits and entrances that the audience is forced to recognise the personal tragedy of a love that spoke no words .

To a foreign correspondent covering the British election for a foreign This chapter uses two techniques to investigate media influence .

	 and shows how even slightly too much rudder has a significant effect at the stall .  Start to circle in a normal turn with about 20 of Most beginners will find it difficult to apply the opposite rudder ,
	 because of their ingrained habit of using the stick and the rudder in co - ordination .  It is also surprisingly difficult to hold accurate heading during a full airbrake sideslipping approach .  You need to be familiar with the type of glider you are flying because each needs slightly different angles of Many types have a pot pitot in the nose and the ASI indicates a false reading during side - slip .  On some ,
	 the rudder overbalances badly and there is a bad trim change .  Most only need a small angle of Provided that the need of slipping is spotted straight away ,
	 it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground .  The slip is used just to get rid of the excess height so that less than full airbrake is required for the rest of the approach .  With most gliders ,
	the easiest way to enter a side - slip and to hold the heading is to freeze the rudder central while applying the Provided the approach path was correct beforehand ,
	 the adverse yaw as the aileron is applied swings the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path .  The opposite rudder is then applied to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turning .  Most beginners apply the opposite rudder too harshly and this makes it difficult to hold the Attempt this in a gentle turn as well ,
	 and in a gentle turn with a little too much rudder .  This time it will almost certainly drop a wing ,
	 but just easing forwards a little will make a recovery .  Try some very steep turns and then some with about 40 of This is a matter of constantly exploring out a few yards on almost every circle to try to find the best possible area of lift .  Frequently this involves turning steeply at low speed to keep the radius of turn to a minimum and to make use of the narrow cores of lift .  Remember ,

	 For many ,
	 the day provided a reaffirmation of the vision for ACET and a marvellous sense of unity .  It was the first time our national and international network had gathered together in one place and made us all realise just how much the work has grown .  Three visitors from Frankfurt ,

	recently visited ACET's offices before returning home to It's  always on your mind You can't look your family in the eye .  Your friends You can't look your family in the eye .  Your friends begin to wonder what is wrong .  You on behalf of a client Thank you for all the help you gave to us and to Bob during the last few days of his illness  I only wish we'd been put in touch with ACET sooner .  I was particularly impressed by the way you managed to organise all the available services so efficiently just at the time when we were Hundreds of thousands of people have appealed for their freedom .  And the prisoners themselves know that they are not alone ,
	 that the world has not forgotten them .  The 1990s Mohamed Abbad remains in prison with 17 of the original 31 .  He was originally held in Safi Prison ,
	 where he developed diabetes in 1988 ,
	 but was then transferred to Marrakech where his family lives ,
	 and so could visit him regularly and provide him with the food necessary for his diabetic diet .  On 26 March 1991 he was returned to Safi Prison and in protest he He asserted that a modern artist should be in tune with his times ,
	 careful to avoid hackneyed subjects .  Typically ,
	 a laudatory essay he wrote was called The Painter of Modern Life  on the subject of the illustrator Constantin Guys ;  this gifted if minor artist was accurately targeted by Baudelaire as being in the mainstream of contemporary social and political life .  Guys' drawings appeared in such papers as the Illustrated London News ,
	a very successful venture CHRONOLOGICAL SURVEYS The White Rabbit had put on his spectacles ,
	 but he did not know where to start .  The best preliminary plan may be for the reader to open the book upright at  ( the illustration )  and then go to the other side of the room ,
	 to be imposed on from a distance :  it is the nearest the book can offer to the proper first encounter with the figure .  There is no one way of looking at a sculpture by Leinberger and similarly there is no one angle or distance from which we see it anything like whole ,
	 but there is something like a normal sequence of approach .  This This begins with the figure impinging powerfully from a distance ,
	 in this case as one walks into St Martin's  at Landshut ,
	 more powerfully than other things in the field of view .  What carries most punch here is ,
	 of course ,
	 the gilt y - shaped motif of the folds offered by the Virgin's  mantle to stretch a phrase ,

	 resulted in Canaday's  being censured by the American art critics'  association .  A case of unwitting collusion by a critic in a manoeuvre by an art  dealer occurred in 1961 ,
	 when Leo Steinberg wrote an article about Jasper Johns .  Johns was a puzzling phenomenon for Steinberg ,

	 and for what he  has to say about convergences of the two ,
	 and about the curbs which revolution and its regimes has placed on them .  The West has been grateful to Kundera ,

	 and so allows for greater flexibility of characterisation .  Her trial scene ( Act 3 ,

I wish to express my sincerest thanks to all those taking part ,
	 and for giving me their time .  For fairly obvious reasons the conversations But the British government was still involved in the reproduction of antagonisms in the Ulster statelet ,
	 rather than passively accepting the perpetuation of inequalities and discrimination against the catholic  nationalist minority .  O'Dowd ,
	 Rolston ,
	 and Tomlinson  ( 1980 )  point out that when the centralized state comes in simply to administer and maintain law and order ,
	 it tends to reproduce relationships which pre - exist its intervention .  When the British state For example ,

	 the previous bishop of Down and Connor ,
	 Dr Philbin ,
	 refused for most of his period of leadership in Belfast to have Jesuits visiting or residing in his diocese .  Not that the prohibition always succeeded .  It They are thus not simply a mentality derived from popular religion but from a traditional Roman catholicism which held sway in catholic Europe from the post - Reformation period and remained unchallenged until the 1960s .  As will be seen in Chapter 5 ,
	 understanding this religious social consciousness requires some grasp of the traditional catholic teaching on the natural order and the good society ,
	 and how the nation is to respect the divine order  established by God .  An example of this can be taken from the recent contraception controversy in the Republic ,
	which Testing the Alliance 2 :  The Mother and Child Scheme Controversy The second case reveals even more the extent to which the legitimation of the state was a Roman catholic affair ,
	 at least as one of the two principal sources of power in the alliance .  From the early 1940s ,
	the Irish government When the next government under de Valera introduced a very limited scheme of public health assistance in 1952 ,
	 the hierarchy still opposed its introduction ,
	 and by direct methods as well .  Only de Valera's  personal intervention convinced them of their lack of perception and judgement .  It was the 1960s before the bishops The episode shows ,
	 as Whyte says ,
	 not a clash between Church and State but a shifting consensus involving them both ,
	  ( 1980 : 399 )  .  A further significant change in political religious attitudes occurred with the liberalization of legislation prohibiting contraceptives to be bought or sold ,
	 or even imported into the state .  A campaign When it fell to Dukes to introduce the second stage of the Bill empowering the referendum ,
	 he was forced to address himself specifically to the bishops'  arguments in their letter  ( text ,
	 Irish Times  ,
	 15 May 1986 )  .  Similar remarks were made by Senator Mary Robinson ,
	 who also challenged the hierarchy's  intent in their statement to the New Ireland Forum that the civil rights of Northerners would not be infringed by any pressure from the Roman catholic church in an eventual united Ireland .  TDs who opposed the amendment ,
	such as Oliver J. Flanagan on 13 May and Dr Michael Woods on 14 May ,
	Religious education in these schools is officially non - denominational or biblically based and loyalist sentiments are promoted .  But religious education has been known to be fundamentalist and in some cases anti - catholic ,
	 depending on the teacher .  It is important to note that ,
	since the system These schools come under the control of the Department of Education ,
	 through locally appointed committees .  They are organizationally secular schools ,
	 though some clergy are members of the local governing committees and this has always been a feature .  The community or comprehensive - type schools which are Until recently ,
	 catholics in the North were practically forbidden by their clergy to attend state schools ,
	 exceptions being made in certain outlying areas .  Bishop Edward Daly in Derry liberally interpreted the needs of his Roman catholic pupils from the mid - 1970s ,
	 allowing greater freedom and seeing to it that some alternative religious education was provided .  At the same time ,
	the late Bishop Philbin The reason given was that children would not be religiously and  educationally prepared for the reception of Holy Communion and Confirmation because they had not been educated at a catholic school ,
	 irrespective of their parents'  alternative provisions :  in one area ,
	 parents had set up their own Sunday schools as an alternative .  The measures were felt to be particularly harsh by those catholic parents who were getting involved with the All Children Together movement .  Some of its parents had I began work on the big glass on 27 July 1967 ,

	 and then written up and published .  It exists largely as a product of the institutions of higher education ( Sarsby 1984 : 132 ) and has only recently It is here that an anthropological observing participation comes into its own ,
	 for in living with the semantics of the system the analyst has the potential to undertake a rarely used method of social research .  This contains the experience and depth of the insider's  knowledge ,

	 simply because there is a lack of impetus within contemporary sociology to spend lengthy periods of observation in what may be uncomfortable research situations with the police .  And here the problem really They get far more than they bargain for .  ( Grillo 1980 :  3 )  In effect ,

	 and social change only occurs when irresistible and more powerful forces are brought to bear from outside  ( see Adams 1988 )  .  Furthermore ,

	always aiming to deliver your response just as your opponent is It is useful to know which is the likely response to your committed attack and that is one way of finding out .  We will explore this further in the chapter dealing with tactics .   Deliver your attack even as the opponent Blocking Kicks Of all the kicks used in competition the high roundhouse kick is perhaps the easiest to see ,
	 though there are ways of disguising this .  If your opponent attempts a roundhouse kick to one side of your head ,
	thrust forwards off your rear foot as soon as his foot lifts and the hips However ,
	 all the time your shoulder leads ,
	 your centre - line is not facing the opponent ,
	 so you are vulnerable to a strong counter - attack .  Lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range ,
	 and raise your other hand as a guard .  Unfortunately ,

	 range ,
	 power ,
	 control ,
	 etc. Before It follows that if you can deliver an effective and continuous attack ,
	 your chances of scoring are higher than when you throw a single technique .  When putting a combination together ,

Then in the 1979 paper he found that subjects placed the time of occurrence of this sensation only a few milliseconds after the peripheral stimulus which evoked it .  So although the ERP had to persist for several hundred milliseconds before the subject felt anything ,
	they nevertheless reported that the sensation had occurred at the moment when the ERP was This apparently backward causality ,

	 and to avoid drifting down wind whenever possible .  Beginners often continue to struggle with weak lift without realising  that they are ,
	 in fact ,
	 losing height and drifting further away .  If the variometer is fluctuating and reading up on one side of the circle and down a little on the other ,
	the probability is that the glider is not Thus the pilots who are flying several different types of glider ,
	 or a glider which is unfamiliar to them ,
	 must ask themselves before each flight ,
	 Do I need the stick forward to lift the tail ,
	 or back a little to lift the nose ?  With gliders which have a front wheel or main skid ,
	 a main wheel just behind the c.g .  and a tail - wheel or skid like the K13 ,
	 Grob 103 ,
	 ASK21 ,
	 Puchazc ,
	 Schweitzer 233 and most of the older single seaters ,
	 it may be necessary to ease back a little during the take - off run to raise the front wheel or skid .  A few seconds later as the aircraft gains more speed ,
	it will need more forward movement to prevent it from unsticking with the tail - wheel or skid touching the ground ,
	and If the launch is too fast the pilot simply pulls up into a steeper climb .  When the driver sees that the load is getting too high ,
	 he reduces the power slightly .  If the speed is too low ,
	the pilot reduces the The optimum speed for a launch depends on both the type of glider and the wind strength .  A minimum safe speed for most gliders is the minimum cruising speed ,
	 but this is only safe at height ,
	 where there is time for recovery if a stall occurs .  In windy conditions ,
	the glider will If the glider stalls on the launch it will probably drop a wing and may spin .  If the launch seems slow ,
	 check the speed every few seconds .  Reducing the Reducing the climbing angle slightly will help the driver to recognise the need for more speed .  However ,
	 levelling out too much will cause a large amount of slack in the cable and a further loss of speed ,
	 often leaving the aircraft in a dangerously nose - high attitude with no pull from the cable to maintain the speed .  With a slow launch the pilot must decide if the speed is sufficient to continue With all the airspace restrictions in operation it is most important to keep track of your location so that the glider does not inadvertently stray into controlled airspace or other restricted areas .  This is particularly true for early attempts at flying cross - country ,
	 where it is vital to use a priority system for concentrating on the important aspects of the flying .  Flying above 1,500 or 2,000 feet on a reasonable day ,
	you should concentrate mainly on After a launch failure of any kind above two or three hundred feet ,
	 once the speed has been checked ,
	 it is best to turn off 90 or so in order to avoid going further from the field .  In this position ,
	 the glider is on a base leg for any available field upwind and it is easy to look back and decide whether returning to the field is practical .  On a normal tow ,
	except for very low performance machines ,
	the It is possible that this has contributed to the risk of the glider zooming too high just after take off .  In windy weather ,
	 the effects of the wind gradient near the ground accentuate any movement up or down of the towplane and glider .  If the towplane gains speed by flying close to the ground ,
	when it noses up to start Pilots should also be briefed about the dangers of raising the undercarriage ,
	 closing the canopy window or fiddling with anything in the cockpit in case they are momentarily distracted or jerk the stick unintentionally during the initial climb out .  From the start ,
	 the need to release immediately if for any reason they lose sight of the towplane must be impressed on the students .  The tow pilot can help by allowing his aircraft to Instructors should test every student before allowing them to go solo to make quite sure that they are not seriously affected by reduced g .  This does not mean pitching violently to get weightlessness or negative g .  The student can be asked to pitch nose - down gently from level flight and from diving and However ,
	 wave flying has its own problems which a pilot must understand and recognise if such flights are to be made safely .  Similarly ,
	 if you are going to fly in a cloud ,
	 it is important to understand the possible hazards in order to avoid them .  Cloud flying ,
	particularly in shower clouds ,
	can be quite a dangerous pastime and on many days it would be totally irresponsible to risk losing a club glider by attempting to Getting lost It is impossible for any glider pilot to make a high cloud climb and to be sure of his position .  For this reason it is not acceptable to make In the past it was thought that the chance of having a glider struck by lightning in cloud was negligible .  However ,

	 palaces and other buildings ,
	 foreign tribes ,
	 dragons and fishes ,

	who may occasionally notice that it underlies the Commemorative figures in city squares ,

	where a high Part of the reason for this is that the American professoriat is the largest in the world ,
	 while the American market for current art is unprecedented ;  it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world .  The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also play a part ,
	 contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society .  Critics can also be invested with a These Africans have not moved into the houses of the Portuguese .  They are passive ,

	 most of the teachers will at some point in their sessions have talked about relaxation .  A lot has to do with how you breathe and how you react physically to moments of tension .  You will be tense at the audition because a lot is at stake ,

	 exceptionally rare these days. Once The Stage  covered all finals productions from the drama schools ,

	and it means they lose out on a In the South ,
	 the marginality of the third main political party ,
	 the Irish Labour Party ,
	 is an indication of just how successful the articulation of capitalism to religious and national beliefs is .  The South is not a classless society ,
	 but its class nature has been well hidden in consciousness and dominated by the procedures of the capitalist - democratic process .  Despite the principal duality of Irish party political power ,
	the bourgeois structure of the state has rarely been questioned ,
	only the The Religious Component of Catholic Nationalism There is nothing theoretically which hinders religion being an ingredient ,
	 or even predominating in the nationalist mix .  Roman catholicism and protestantism constitute ,
	in different ways and to varying Catholic morality approves of the view that to repel an aggressor is to engage in a just war .  It just so happens that Irish national  popular consciousness interprets the presence of the British state in Ireland as a form of aggression and hence feel justified in repelling the British from Ireland .  Catholic morality also approves of a proportionate Catholic morality also approves of a proportionate degree of violence to overthrow tyranny .  Many Irish catholic nationalists also consider the British and their Orange allies to have established tyrannical government in a part of Ireland .  Therefore they find it just to overthrow the Northern statelet by whatever A dislike by Irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church  state relationship has a long tradition and comes out best in De Tocqueville's   ( 1957 )  conversations with Irish clergy on his visit to Ireland in 1834 .  When asked if they would like subventions from the state to aid their stipends and church buildings ,
	 a move which was being seriously considered by the British government at the time ,
	 priests and bishops were united in rejecting the idea on the grounds that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people ,
	 identifying clergy with the principal enemies of the people .  De Tocqueville's notes reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people was ,
	the This monopoly position is therefore totally beyond criticism .  One might speculate that an impending solution to the Northern Ireland problem would split off from the clerical leadership those groups for whom the present position is only accepted on pragmatic grounds .  Hence the traditional alliance between catholicism and nationalism might be split at the popular basis with the ensuing growth of a Some catholic nationalists in the South mix with a proportionally much larger number of Southern protestants who ,
	 however ,
	 are loyal to the Southern state .  Part of the reason why Roman catholics go to their own schools is because they believe they are obliged to do so .  The belief is to some The pressure to remodel old pubs is of course nothing new .  The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ;  during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs ,
	 as well as in creating large new ones  ( see Alan Powers'  essay below )  .  However ,
	alterations were more often than not effected with some Both these establishments seem to have had an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic buildings of their area ,
	 and the hall provided the communal eating and drinking space .  The tavern was a meeting place ,
	 usually in the centre of the town or village ,
	 where wine was normally served .  According to John Earle ,
	writing in 1628 ,
	the inn was a superior establishment to the alehouses and was a Arguably brewers are still as constrained by the profit motive as ever before .  This may lead to the destruction of further historic pubs which are considered redundant ;  conversely ,
	 this may well lead to the further restoration and conservation of the best historic sites .  It may be an unpalatable thought ,

You also need to become accustomed to thinking and using It exists largely as a product of the institutions of higher education  ( Sarsby 1984 :  132 )  and has only recently begun to surface in policy and practice .  As Okely  ( 1987 :  67 )  observes ,
	 the urge to create publications is not always as crucial to others as it is to the academic .  Indeed for those insiders living in Cheater's metaphorical front room such as in the police the need to obscure and seek a S.U .  was to be encouraged ,
	 eliminating chains of assessment and decision making which had lain within the purview of the superintendent .  A central decision making process involving Inspectors and civilian decision makers was established and developed .  Its early implementation met with a He described the  study of precedent and case law as being real academic activity for police officers ,
	 thus supporting my contention that research into the philosophy of control is unreal or polluting .  He spoke revealingly about the problems he had had with jurisprudence ,
	 bemoaning the fact that it was ambivalent and undefined ,
	 concerned primarily with the ambiguity which sustains the anthropologist by revealing the centralities of a system :  it was all grey areas ;  no black and white certainties or decisions ;  no precedent or case law giving the definitive interpretation .  At the Police Staff College shortly before I was offered the scholarship to university ,
	I had listened as lists of He must come to terms with living with this consciousness and with the inherent problems he will face in revealing this knowledge to the outside in an ethnographic account .  Moreover ,
	 he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he has previously accepted ,
	 perhaps without thinking ,
	 which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible .  And having long been supported by the institution he will be crucially aware that it expects a It would be paradoxical for them to be in the vanguard of social change ,
	 for as Templeton  ( 1980 )  points out ,
	 they are there to preserve the structure ;  to uphold the state of play .  But there are a few who are  questioning the  state of play ,
	 and who agree with Ben Whitaker  ( 1979 :  312 )  when he urged that police thinking would profit if it more often came out of its shell and concerned itself with wider questions about the role of the police and human relations .  However ,
	this is not always easy to achieve ,
	as I found out when I first returned to work in 1977 after my This directive encourages officers to research and study in their own time and lists suitable subjects ,
	 which include public administration ,
	 management studies ,
	 economics ,
	 law ,
	 criminology ,
	 social sciences ,
	 youth work ,
	 English language and literature and relevant modern languages .  The circular goes on to point out that the list is not exhaustive and suggests other courses may be appropriate .  I had applied to continue full - time research following my Another inspector from Merseyside ,
	 reading social studies at Liverpool ,
	 said :  I felt isolated ,
	 not just ignored ,
	 but socially dead  ( personal communication )  .  Smith  ( ibid .  157 )  also touches on the crucial feeling of potentiality which the university experience can produce in the individual ,
	 but which the police are generally unable to incorporate .  Yet another inspector returning to Leicester with a It would ,
	 of course ,
	 have revealed some aspects of the variable world of police culture to the outside and this was unacceptable .  Another writer on the police met similar problems when he wished to write and publish .  I had discussed the problems of insider analysis with him at a 1988 Police Conference ,
	where he described how ,
	on return to his force after his undergraduate Indeed ,
	 the fact that he had apparently used an editor from a Manchester newspaper for some of his purposes was latched onto and quoted as a sign that he was suspect and disloyal .  One consequence of these modes of thought is that the service has to live out a continuous and enormous paradox .  Even at the same time as it publicly commends higher education ,
	seeking out the graduate entrant ,
	spending large sums on publicity to this end ,
	and funding access to Furthermore ,
	 such pressures are limited ,
	 thus creating a situation where there has been hardly any research on the police compared with the large output of critical scholarship on industry ,
	 commerce ,
	 the civil service ,
	 the health service and education what little direct research there has been on the police has scarcely begun to ask such fundamental questions as what is the police force and what is it doing .  This point ( Wojtas 1982 ) occurs in a description of a new research centre for Police Studies at Strathclyde University ,
	which is to ask whether anyone is doing research on the police ,
	what The conference was also told that as an alternative to the expense of sending officers to university ,
	 it was proposed to  direct  officers to research a particular problem and give them a short period to carry out intensive research .  The emphasis on directed research is mine and indicates the reduced potential for any ethnographic sedition ,
	 for which force would seek to direct officers to the critical analysis of its subcultural idiosyncrasies ?  Furthermore ,
	such short periods of directed research can be shown favourably as a saving over any extended It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force  police service which remains unresolved ,

	 so much of what had been gained in the late 1970s was lost as the economic recession started to bite .  The impact was twofold .  The sharp decline in business activity severely reduced the volume of full - fare first - class ticket sales while the increase in unemployment and interest rates curtailed to a drastic An important feature of the 1980s which has contributed to InterCity's  financial turnround is market segmentation and pricing  or the shaping of products to meet the needs of customer groupings .  Essentially this concept is not new  from the early days our railways were providing first -  ,
	 secondand even third - class accommodation and the excursion ticket was quickly used to sell spare capacity .  What is new is the much greater BR could not avoid passing its dramatically increased costs following the oil crisis on to its customers ,
	 especially London commuters ,
	 and as they reduced in number  ( demand falling at 1 per cent a year )  services ,
	 stock and facilities were reduced to match demand ,
	 inevitably causing poor morale .  Even the ever - ebullient Sir Peter Parker saw parts of the commuter system rattling into decline ,
	 and nobody was surprised when in 1979 the government referred the services to the Monopolies  Mergers Commission. The Commission's report was perhaps the turning point ,
	for while it paid respect to the management it found to be totally dedicated to the railway with a high Through the late 1980s another force was at work which turned the Provincial sector's  fortunes further round .  Increasing prosperity in the United Kingdom meant that people had more spare cash ,
	 and much of this was spent on an increase in personal travel .  The new trains on the Provincial routes therefore had a market with a It is free from many of the constraints of timetabling ,

	has exposed the strengths and weaknesses of individual traffic flows and kept the Few would deny that the railway is admirably suited to carrying this type of traffic .  So as the 1980s drew to a close ,

Similar passages of critical reflection or speculation can be found in many books .  Formal Does an English liking for watercolour spring from the country's  climate ?

The simplest and most fundamental aspect of cognisance  ( fundamental philosophically and developmentally )  is what is usually referred to as self - world dualism :  the knowledge that there is a physical world out there of which I am an experiencer and that is distinct from me .  Mental development ,

	 we would expect the input systems to ensure that the right kinds of distinctions are drawn  between contour changes that define occlusion and those which define disappearance ,

The result was that the social pressure had no effect at all .  In children between four and eight years of age there was absolutely no Where will the child now point ?  If he points to the empty box then it is probably fair to regard this as deliberate misinforming ,

In fact we did find a clear Initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose interest and start to look away  ( habituation )  ;  if the stimulus is then changed in some way and if this causes a re - awakening of interest  ( dishabituation )  then we can assume that the baby has detected the change .  Another technique is preferential looking .  If the subject prefers to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he has detected a The problem is that it is highly improbable that a group of patients with brain injury constitute a natural kind ,

	 although neither can be called a character or national work  ( see page 28 )  .  Choreographers can make subtle These dances mattered very much to Petipa and all nineteenthcentury balletmasters because they were expected to show off the wealth of talent found in the many imperial ,
	 Royal and State theatres ,
	 e.g. all the characters from other fairy tales who came to Aurora's  wedding and the character dances in Swan Lake  .  Mimed dance and danced mime  However ,
	 the strict division of a ballet into four distinct kinds was eliminated by Fokine when he totally cut the scne d'action  from his first ballets and never replaced them .  Instead ,

Despite the great The cold air is made even more apparent by the swift footwork when the entire cast jump lightly upwards away from the ground .

	there is a very great deal of The events and circumstances surrounding such plots are difficult to control and organise because the characters are supposedly living in the real world .  So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting .  He can only highlight the atmosphere supporting the plot ,

	 in turn ,
	 gave the book a mockingly dismissive review in the TLS  ,
	 without mentioning Nuttall's  accusation against him. Nuttall ,
	 like Thurley ,
	 writes with a polemical edge ,

	and both of them are concerned as were Thurley and Nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language is a system of pure In principle it would be quite possible for the study of English poetry to begin in a similar ab initio  fashion ,
	 except that it would be fruitless for someone to embark on it who did not have at least some familiarity with poetry and a wish to read more .  This is because the study of poetry as  poetry  rather than as historical or cultural material  is a matter of intuitive and affective response ,
	 not just of willingness to accept an intellectual discipline ,
	 as might be the case with philosophy ,
	 economics ,
	 and so forth .  ( I grant that the To see these activities as representing the apotheosis of Morris Zapp and the eclipse of Phillip Swallow is tempting but too simple .  British versions of Zapp are probably now in  America anyway ,
	 finding a proper market - based reward for their talents and energy .  American professionalism may be the ideal ,
	but And ,
	 least definably ,
	 there is the cultural nationalism ,
	 the concept of Englishness that ,
	 from the beginning ,
	 has been a major element in the subject .  It produces a mystique which obstructs total professionalism and separates British from American attitudes .  Yet despite these Raymond Williams came to think that a splitting of the discipline was increasingly likely ,
	 since cultural materialism and radical semiotics were not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study :  For these necessarily include the paradigm itself as a matter for analysis ,
	 rather than as a governing definition of the object of knowledge .  In this situation ,
	 the question had to be raised :  can a radically different work still be carried on under a single heading or department when there is not just diversity of approach but more serious and fundamental Newbolt's  attitude is still very common  not only among the British   ( especially those who have come under the influence of F. R. Leavis )  ,
	 but also among American free versifiers who think they are an avantgarde and who are muddled enough to think that they have Pound's  authority to back them .  Whether they know it or not ,
	 they are in fact endorsing Henry Newbolt against Pound !  All the same ,
	there is by and large a crucial Fire has to consume to give off its light .  But light gets its knowledge  and has its intelligence and its being  by going over things without the necessity of eating the substance of things in the process of purchasing its truth .  Maybe this is the This is what Pound could never have said .  When ,
	 infrequently ,
	 he wanted to write in some simple metre ,
	 he did so ;  but when more often he wanted to get away from standard metres ,
	 he left them behind altogether ,
	 no ghost of them lurking behind his arras .  The Thus Pound was quite ready ,
	 and became eager ,
	 to deliver a message ,
	 though with more obliquities and delays than the impatiently moralistic reader could see reason for ;  whereas Eliot ,
	 true to his inheritance from French symbolisme  ,
	 was sceptical and chary of conveying in poetry any message at all .  ( Pound had studied some of the same French poets ,
	 notably Laforgue and Rimbaud ,
	 but he had profited by them in a quite different way from Eliot ,
	 and he was averse to the central thrust of the symboliste  endeavour ,
	 to which indeed the imagist or imagiste  movement which he had sponsored had been intended as a challenging alternative .  )  The Pound seems to have no interest in that .  Is it not the case that George Herbert and Christina Rossetti and even Lionel Johnson are devoutly Christian poets ,
	 whereas Pound is militantly non - Christian ?  And if Pound so blithely overlooks that Ivor Stanbrook ,
	 MP for Orpington ,
	 who chairs the Conservative backbench constitutional affairs committee and is an Anglican ,

Although significant So ,
	 when a company first looks to expand abroad ,
	 the same process needs to be adopted .  Too many companies enter foreign markets without analysing sufficiently either the customers or the competition in those markets .  International marketing differs from its domestic counterpart due purely to the Levitt simply asserts the opposite  that low - cost operations are the stamp of corporate cultures pervaded by the ethos of quality .  They are ,
	 he says ,
	 compatible ,
	 twin identities of superior practice .  There is another way of viewing Levitt's arguments ; the relative importance of between - country and within - country Levitt considers many Japanese companies as the first truly global marketers and contrasts their practices strongly with the approach taken by Hoover in marketing automatic washing machines in Europe .  In the 1960s ,
	 Hoover was looking to increase the output of its manufacturing plant closer to its capacity level and so intended to boost its sales in mainland Europe .  Market research showed considerable However ,
	 whilst this method of comparison relies on easily available information ,
	 it is not exact ;  exchange rates relate to goods which are traded internationally ,
	 whilst the the majority of the national product of most countries is comprised of goods which never enter the international marketplace .  The differences in real income can thus be distorted .  As just one example ,

Univariate and bivariate analysis Statistical techniques can be used to compare survey data ( primary data ) collected in one country with survey data from another country ,
	in order to test for similarities or For example ,
	 a survey of 1,800 working women in France might show that 38 %  read at least one magazine weekly ,
	 and a similar survey in West Germany of 940 working women showed that 47 %  of them read at least one magazine weekly .

A breakdown is possible only for large - circulation papers like the Sun  and the Mirror  .  Amongst Mirror readers ,
	there was no This chapter uses two techniques to investigate media influence .  To assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trends in television news content and trends in overall public perceptions .  To assess the impact of more differentiated media sources we can look for But this effect had declined to only 22 per cent by the last fortnight of the campaign .  Similarly ,
	 readers of lowbrow papers were relatively ill - informed about polls before the campaign but caught up on highbrow readers later :  the effect of reading a highbrow paper declined from 33 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave to only 15 per cent in the closing stages of the campaign .  By contrast ,
	the We have already noted the correlation between overall trends in perceptions of opinion polls and trends in perceptions of party prospects  ( see Table 7.3 )  .  At any one time there were wide differences of opinion about party chances however .  Some of those A trend analysis confirms these regression findings .  There was always an enormous difference between the economic perceptions of those who initially had Conservative and Labour preferences ,

	 the difference between net optimism amongst Conservative and Labour supporters exceeded 100 per cent :  it was 105 per cent in the Pre - Campaign Wave ,
	 rising to 121 per cent by the end of the campaign .  Amongst party identifiers as a whole ,
	the Public awareness of opinion polls was most predictable in the Pre - Campaign Wave and became steadily less predictable as the election approached and awareness spread throughout the electorate .  Before the campaign opened the key influence on poll awareness was a generalized interest in politics ,
	 but as the  campaign drew to an end television viewing became more important .  Before the campaign there was a 41 per cent Before the campaign there was a 41 per cent difference in awareness of polls between those with high and low levels of interest in politics ;  but this declined to 22 per cent by the end of the campaign .  Readers of lowbrow papers were relatively ill informed about polls before the campaign but caught up with highbrow readers later .  Conversely the But that is only part of the explanation for the magnitude of their swing to the Conservatives .  The fact that uncommitted voters who read the Sun  or Star  swung so much more than other uncommitted voters  suggests that these papers were particularly good at influencing their readers .  Swings were highest amongst voters who watched both BBC and ITV news ,

	 papers like the Guardian  and Telegraph  did seem to influence their readers as much as the tabloids ,
	 but not on the question of voting choice .  Persistent Guardian  readers swung strongly towards a more unilateralist position ,
	 while Telegraph  and Times  readers swung in the opposite direction .  The That may be true ,
	 but in 1987 hostile interviews with Neil Kinnock trying to explain his party's  defence policy counted as part of the Labour Party's  coverage .  Coverage of all  kinds can be both favourable and unfavourable  no matter whether politicians are in government or in opposition  and politicians themselves must bear the prime responsibility for ensuring that when they do get access to the media they present their own case well .  There is no Right - wing readers of a right - wing paper were more  likely than left - wing readers of that same paper to claim that their paper was biased towards the right  though a majority of both left -  and right - wing readers typically agreed that their papers were biased and agreed on the direction of that bias .  Instead of reacting against the bias in their chosen paper ,
	 readers tended  ( at the margin )  to defend their paper  ( if it was biased against their party )  or even to glory in its bias  ( if it was biased in favour of their party )  .  The The switch of news focus clearly had some  influence on the public's  agenda but a remarkably small one :  in terms of television influencing the public's  agenda the cause seemed much greater than the effect .

Newer approaches to history can give accounts which do not have landmark events and which tell us about It is perhaps more the stuff of epigrams than analysis .  The idea that there is such a thing as the spirit of a time can be awkwardly challenged by asking ,
	 Whose time ?  No prizes can be offered for pointing out that at a given moment there are artists of several generations working and in very The art criticism in such books generally has a slant ,
	 questioning whether the country or places have had a determining influence on art .  Robert Paine ,

Pilinski had to redraw his copy of the old and valuable original because he could not paste the original on his block and engrave through it .  Every line is There are many choices of arrangement and treatment available to a monographer .  An art historian may choose to elucidate the social context of the art ,
	 or trace its sources in the work of other artists ;  these choices will be reflected in the illustrations as well as the text ,
	 while sketches ,
	 other versions of pictures and related material will be available for the reader to make comparisons .  Roger Fry ,

	 and Renaissance philosophers discovered that the emancipated artists of their time should have the characteristics of the Saturnine temperament ;  they were contemplative ,

	 in either public or commercial galleries .  Major art museums may devote considerable resources to an individual artist's  exhibition ,
	 on the same scale as a historical show .  But one feature of a catalogue of an exhibition for a living artist which is Sometimes subjects require considerable explanation or interpretation ,
	 and in these cases the museum catalogue can give definitive help .  Interpretation of iconography ,

	 with the group show playing a less important role in the market .  Artists who group together for financial reasons may choose a name which is no more explanatory than a number or numbers .  Thus in London at A cynic will remember that research into the opinion - forming powers of newspapers has tended  to conclude that readers expect to have their existing views confirmed .  If so ,

	 if it is a reality at all  ( which Tye does not dispute )  ,
	 must be a fact about the experience  ( or a feature or aspect of the experience ,

Maybe the reader's  first thought an experiment of my own showed that this is not misinterpretation in any simple sense .  We tested children in pairs so that each child in the pair observed visual illusions from Recall that it was three - year - olds who had difficulty with Flavell's  appearance - versus - reality problems ;  and indeed further experiments have shown that there is a strong  statistical correlation between performance on the appearance - reality and on the false belief task .  Where is the salience effect ?  I would say that the child is capable more or less of recognizing that other people have mental states But surely ,

	 consciousness does  consist of determinate mental episodes .  I think of eating an omelette or walking by the sea and these thoughts have a determinate qualitative or phenomenal content .  And is not the thought of ,

Another exciting window on the mind seemed to open up in Chicago in the 1950s when Nathaniel Kleitman and Bill Dement  began using the techniques of electroencephalography to investigate sleep .  Sleep could be divided into a number of So again ,

Even those who most strongly advocate their use as research tools would admit that we do not know exactly what neural processes generate them and that any particular fluctuation will be the result of a multiplicity of So this damping down of the sensory input when attention moves elsewhere can occur very early in the pathway from the sense organ to the brain .  These early experiments were sometimes difficult to interpret ,

The multitude of Madonnas for Italian worship in the Renaissance made this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which has taken on the task of distinguishing authentic works from those by followers or copyists .  An art critic may have SCULPTURAL MONOGRAPHS Books about sculpture have problems all of their own .  The first and most obvious Clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references .  The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in performance pose Luckily for the curious ,

	 books of details ,

	 from which the authority of other writing derives .  The catalogue of the earlier Italian schools was written by Martin Davies ,
	and published in 1951 . the strength of the gallery's holding of works by Giovanni Bellini made it worth the author's while to write a preliminary note about For example ,

	 the formal analysis which is second nature to a Western critic can be fruitful ,
	 even though it could be argued that this is a way of interpreting the objects of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description .  A further type of PERCEPTION How a spectator views an object is also not a simple matter ,
	 despite this century's  increased knowledge of the psychology of perception .  A In an evaluation the critic may put personal feeling aside .  What is an aesthetic experience ?  The question has puzzled generations of Western historians ,
	critics and philosophers for at least two centuries because of the It was Roger Fry's  contention that an object ,
	 say a bunch of carrots on a market stall ,
	 could be viewed in a practical way as something to eat for supper ,
	 or aesthetically .  This distinction can be backed up by philosophy and aesthetics ,
	 and descriptions can be found of the resultant moments of vision or epiphanies .  Our concern ,

	 the record industry came up with one more development  full frequency - range recording .  The idea of a recording system covering the full range perceived by the human ear dates back to 1925 ,
	 when Brunswick claimed their electrical recordings covered the range from 16Hz to 21000Hz  ( 19 )  .  However ,

	 comprising a coating of ferric oxide on a non - magnetic base .  Despite some significant developments by BBC and Marconi engineers ,
	the system still did not give better quality than 78rpm So the two inventions were not combined until 1940 .  Shortly afterwards ,

	American broadcasters and record companies had abandoned His simpler Dolby B system was adopted for tape cassettes in 1971 ,
	 and was the main reason why this format became so popular as a means of disseminating commercially prerecorded material .  Although even the best tape cassettes could not outperform the best LPs ,

	 and did not develop annoying clicks .  By 1985 sales of tape cassettes were outnumbering By 1982 ,
	 Sony's  system ,
	 using its U - Matic videocassettes for storing 16 - bit digital audio  ( with a potential signal - to - noise ratio of some 96 decibels )  ,
	 had become an industry standard .  Meanwhile ,
	 Philips in Holland had been pioneering the use of Laservision videodiscs ,
	 the least unsuccessful of several types of disc for carrying video films .  These were played by a beam of laser light rather than a stylus ,
	and Philips saw that combining digital audio with laser Of course ,
	 this worries the record companies ,
	  because the potential for piracy is great .  At the time of writing it seems that digital tape recorders sold to the public will have various anti - piracy measures built into them for this very reason .  On the other hand ,
	error - correction pleases the record producers ,
	because compact digital In practice ,
	 all media do have a limited life .  A search is now under way to find a medium with a reliably long shelf - life ,
	 because even if our present - day sound recordings last for a full century  ( which is doubtful )  ,
	 our successors will have to copy the whole collection every hundred years or so .  For analogue sound - recording ,
	experience has shown that the metal masters used in the process of pressing There was no impetus to develop anything more sophisticated than a spoken announcement or a separate piece of paper packed into the box .  This means that many cylinder records surviving today have highly dubious provenances ,
	 as we shall see later .  It is debatable whether it was the cylinder or the The only doubt concerns the date ;  it seems these early records could be from any year between 1889 and 1891 ,
	 so whether Edison or Berliner was actually first to make records with a label is open to debate .  The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder ,
	 since there was insufficient flat space .  The end of the cylinder box had to suffice ( 27 ) ,
	and paper labels were not attached to The conventional paper label was never possible on a cylinder ,

	 left )  .  It should be pointed out that they were nearly always pressed into the This is one reason why metallic inks ,
	 such as gold or silver ,
	 were common .  In later years ,
	 paper labels served another function :  they acted like gaskets ,
	 preventing molten material from getting into the mechanism for punching the centre hole .  Half a century later ,
	when vinyl Half a century later ,
	 when vinyl discs became the norm ,
	 there was another complication .  Vinyl required greater temperatures in the press ,
	 and the molten material flowed with much less viscosity .  So if ordinary paper labels curled up during the manufacturing process ,
	they would take the vinyl with them ,
	resulting in a warped This      was not only designed to withstand the heat without soaking up liquid vinyl like blotting - paper ,
	 but it was supplied with a distinctive pattern on the back to indicate the direction of the paper grain .  When two labels were inserted in the press with their grains at right - angles ,
	 any tendency for the paper to distort in one direction in preference to the other was neutralized .  25 Berliner 27 Cylinder boxes .  The ends of cylinder boxes carried the nearest the cylinder format ever got to labels .  28 Paper labels for The idea of filling the engravings with white greatly added to the legibility ,
	 but the conventional cylinder  ( just over two inches in diameter )  had insufficient space for much more than the title .  This didn't matter very much as cylinders soon found themselves right at the bottom of the class structure of recordings ,
	 and not many featured artists worth naming .  As disc records took a greater hold of the market ,

	most disc manufacturers with double - sided The Act permitted such stamps to be affixed to the container ,
	 rather than the record itself ;  this was the only practicable way with cylinders .  But the Board of Trade had a great deal of latitude to vary the precise details of the arrangement ,
	 and insisted that ,
	 for discs ,
	 the records should bear the stamps ,
	 not the sleeves .  As it was difficult to make stamps adhere to records without paper labels ,

	 and his contract stipulated that the records should be retailed at 1.00 each .  He made his recordings in 1904 and died a year later ;  by 1925 they had been moved to the Historic Catalogue .  32 Edison diamond It is not so much the label which affects the collectability of early rock records ,
	 but the nature of this optional centre .  Until 1957 the Decca group in Great Britain made a  detachable  piece in the shape of a triangle  ( 35 )  .  These triangle centres tend to fetch high prices among collectors ,
	because they are pretty safe guarantees that the However ,
	 since in this situation customers never knew what they were buying ,
	 the scheme didn't last very long .  Alas ,
	 the biggest deceptions in gramophone history comprised serious music ,
	 which was for many years cut down ,
	 both in duration and instrumentation .  The first symphony to be recorded was Schubert's Unfinished published on one twelve - inch A sound archivist will want a recording which gets close to the sound of the original master - tape .  The rights to Presley's  Sun recordings were acquired by RCA Victor together with the rights to the artist ,
	 and although it is now known that the tapes in RCA Victor's  vault are not actually the 1955 originals ,
	 they are extremely good copies ,
	 and all have been reissued on compact disc .  Thus collectors can get back to the sound of the original master - tape far more closely than would be possible with any 1955 The Black Album ,
	 being a pure black sleeve  ( apart from lettering on the spine )  ,
	 was also particularly easy to reproduce .  There are three records which have defied the searches of record - collectors ,
	 and since no one alive today has examples to compare them with ,
	 they would seem to be prime candidates for potential forgers .  Two were scheduled for issue as Fonotipia 69000 and 69001 ,
	single - sided The above non - existent records are ,
	 as I say ,
	 obvious candidates for forgery ,
	 but the simple fact of their being made by obsolete technology makes it less likely that forgeries will appear .

	 reportedly for 10,000 .  The Longer - Playing Recordings Three factors  ( size ,
	 speed ,
	 and groove - pitch )  might be manipulated to make long - playing records .  And because The recordings comprised uninterrupted performances of opera overtures ,
	 but they cost ten shillings and sixpence each ,
	 and needed an outsize turntable .  So customers spent their money on twelve - inch discs instead ,
	 and in fact I have never seen a twenty - inch Neophone record .  The Marathon The new discs were also hill - and - dale ,
	 recorded with a relatively fine groove - pitch of 150 lines per inch ,
	 so a ten - inch side played rather longer than usual  ( about five minutes )  .  The grooves were U - bottomed with a radius of precisely 4.7 thousandths of an inch ,
	 and his reproducers were fitted with the very  first diamond styli ,
	 of exactly this size for minimum wear and surface - noise .  But the grooves were very shallow by normal This proved to many people's  satisfaction that Edison's  re - creation was indistinguishable from the original .  Unfortunately ,
	 Edison was not himself a musician ,
	 and the technology he fathered was never used for mass - producing serious musical records .  Since 1910 he had been recording They were taken to America for mass - production .  It seems ,
	 however ,
	 that everything Edison actually issued was American home - grown corn .   50 A twenty - inch Path Bigger cylinders allowed this to happen without extra wear .  But since all large commercially - made cylinders seem to have been copied from standard ones ,
	 there was no  increase in quality ,
	 only in volume .  The principle that larger cylinders will withstand more wear can also be applied to They combined the two features of flexibility and long - playing time .  A relatively thin piece of cardboard  more like thick paper ,
	 really  was coated on one side with a material called Durium .  Because it was single - sided ,
	the groove pitch was doubled to allow two numbers on each None of these unbreakable records succeeded in displacing shellac .  Actually ,
	 shellac was perhaps the least important constituent ;  the most important was slate dust ,
	 whose abrasive and gritty properties were needed for a rather unusual reason .  As we saw earlier ,
	In the late 1950s ,
	 for example ,
	 listeners had to learn how to listen to stereo .  The two microphone techniques mentioned earlier were then rivals ,
	 and professional engineers and amateurs could not easily switch from one to the other ,
	 much less judge absolute fidelity .  53 An unusual record combining the qualities of a picture Bones ,

We had next to none when I was at drama school and young actors need to know more about what will be When I got my first job out of training it was at Worthing in a juvenile leading role and I got my Equity card because I had been chosen .

	the laity would not understand the complexity of the issues because of their poor understanding of Christian doctrine and the intricacies of morality ; on the other ,
	the area of the sacred in the political arena was clearly defined ,
	and clear guidance from the clerical church was both necessary and Bishop Daly then said :  there must be ,

	for they are ( Police  magazine ,

	 and must know that this denigration stems from the implicit threat they pose to the structures of pedagogy and institutional power .  Those who pursue explication can Alternative readings or critical analysis of this entrenched reverence for a rule of law  ( which at times may well be out of step with a wider interpretation of ambiguous social behaviour )  smacks of subversion simply because it denies the primacy of the institutional framework .  And surely ,

But it is not just how the new consciousness is to be used which produces problems in handling this new - found wisdom ;  it is the very acquisition of knowledge itself which makes the concept of self so dynamic .  This structural awareness can be as hard to handle as any decision to try to publish the account ,

	 the cultural style required in the body of the police officer inevitably sets him slightly apart from the civvies outside the institution ,
	 especially where such symbolic use of clothing and beards or hair is the province of the youthful innovator .  Always the police prefer to exhibit bodily constraint in their styles ,

As you might This must of necessity put you in a very weak defensive position and I would maintain that this is responsible for losing more bouts than any other factor .  The kick misses ,

	 Adolpho Venturi ,
	 who had made a substantial contribution to the publication of documents of Italian art .  Venturi's  survey started with classical times ,

	 lists of lost works such as the treatise by Apelles ,
	 and settled down to comment on  two fundamental categories of criticism ,
	 the lives of artists ,
	 and the critic's  encounter with the work of art .  For the latter he quoted a sentence by Lucian ,
	the second - century Greek rhetorician : A work of art requires an intelligent spectator who must go beyond the pleasure of the eyes to By modernity I mean the ephemeral ,
	 the fugitive ,
	 the contingent ,
	 the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable .  Modernity also had other manifestations .  In his review for the Salon of 1846 ,
	Baudelaire wrote : To say Romanticism is to say modern art that is spirituality ,
	colour ,
	aspiration towards the infinite ,
	The influence of an international market is not easy to be precise about ,
	 though the appearance of work in a Biennale or an art fair can be impressive in itself .  The critic here may be acting as an exhibition organiser or co - ordinator ,
	 critical decisions being mainly limited to selection .  Private collections are examples of critical judgement in action ,
	so that both their catalogues and the opinions Literary careers can be founded on the impersonation and adulation of privileged behaviour ;  but the literary works which have been written and inspired by English snobs and sports are by no means all boastful or complicit .  The supreme text of recent years is James Fox's  account of Lord Lucan and his set ,
	 with their boffes de politesse  .  Patrician insolence has quite often appeared to This is a generic something :  I am speaking here of a literary practice long and widely and variously undertaken ,
	 in relation to which Roth is both critic and executant .  But it should also be said that some elements of this description of mine could be taken to characterise the activity ,
	 sometimes ominous enough in its human implications ,
	 of all imaginative writers ,
	 however remote they may be from the dualistic confederacy .  The caveats Policing issues are never long out of the headlines  ( Chibnall 1977 )  ,
	 and this media obsession has been transmitted into a  wealth of analyses of policing  which have mostly been carried out by outside observers .  Indeed insider accounts have largely consisted of bland reminiscences in the style of my greatest arrests and cases and it has been left to investigative journalism to redress some unacceptable police activity ,

	 one from which Leonard suffered in particular ,
	 albeit outwardly in guarded silence :  The deeper the sorrow ,
	 the less tongue it has ,
	 said the rabbis .  His mother sought to protect him from the usual customs such as summoning the relatives to his father's  bedside ,
	 but the trauma was nevertheless very deeply felt .  Leonard recently referred to the memory of his father as a dark mass or mountain ,
	of which ,
	clearly ,
	the details were too painful for the young boy to register or the adult to He was also a disciple of Ezra Pound ,
	 more  ( one suspects )  because Pound was the most controversial ,
	 dynamic and stimulating figure in modern literature ,
	 than for personal rapport  between the two men .  Pound was a bohemian figure ,
	 despite his Quaker origins ,
	 who espoused an anti - credit economic philosophy which thrust him into anti - Semitism .  Leonard found this hard to stomach ,
	and frequently The spice - box itself is one of the most suggestive symbols in Judaism ;  one which forcefully elucidates the Sabbath festivities ,
	 or at least their completion .  Whatever we may make of Leonard's  Judaism ,
	 he is a man seized by its traditions ,
	 its scriptures and their imagery .  His mind is replete with it ,
	and no real understanding of it ,
	as Even as the BeSHT delighted his listeners  with his pearls of wisdom ,
	 his stunning turns - of - phrase ,
	 his aphoristic acuity ,
	 so Leonard was learning his own ,
	 parallel metier ;  the butterfly was following him down the hill .  The negative side of all this was ben Eliezer's  polemics against straight - faced ,
	 over - serious rabbinism ;  against those whose understanding of God's  nature was austere and unfatherly ;  those who ,
	 while seeking to elevate the Most High ,
	 merely put him out of touch with his own children ;  debarred them from his welcoming presence by a system or learning that became frivolous in its intensity :  not that its perpetrators could be frivolous :  black was their colour ,
	 even as severity was their posture  as becomes the frozen - in - soul .  For such ,
	God only frowns on the world ,
	and stirs it to judgment ; the butterfly cannot break loose into flight ; it merely expires ,

	 or vice versa  .  This can be Where does the meaning come in ?  It can only come in as some kind of emergent property of all these causal interactions .  Well if that is the case ,
	then this is just another way of And there has been a remarkable interchange of ideas between computational theorists and neuroscientists ,
	 in which attempts to create computer models of neural function have not only generated powerful new tools for the interpreting of the brain but have also fed back into computer theory and practice .  At every level  from the simple oligosynaptic circuits involved in the tropisms of primitive organisms to the complex neural activity implicit in human perception  computational models dominate scientific thought .  The converging conceptual worlds of computational theory and neuroscience are She feels  imperialized ,

	 thinking about what it means to belong somewhere ,
	 what it might mean to belong to this idea called theatre .  And we are discovering that we are not interested in exploring the finer points of alienation with tea cuppery ,
	but that the theatre can be a bridge of bone between sickness and health that our language will somehow always be on the edge of poetry and that image and metaphor are our natural tools they best In addition ,

The story ballet A story ballet demands that the circumstances and events occurring as the plot unfolds will be seen to affect the lives and personalities of the characters involved and that dance and gesture will Some of the same movements are repeated yet again in the final pas de deux  ,
	 when the Prince raises her high above the glistening Stars before leading  her away to the land where they lived happily ever after ,
	 where all fairy tales should end .  Dance leitmotifs can be found in most of Ashton's  ballets and are sometimes marked by his particular use of one step or pose .  This was first apparent in The Quest ( 1943 ) where the arabesques danced in many ways became the movement through which Una ( danced by Margot Fonteyn ) Generally speaking ,
	 choreographers can approach their task in three different ways .  An objective view  Choreographers wish to This definition should be understood as the choreographer's  ability to establish a style of movement through which the audience will feel and understand what the performers are communicating through a particular way of dancing .  The style must disclose and be expressive of the moods ,
	 emotions and actions of the roles played even where few personal feelings are allowed to show ,
	 as in such ballets as Ashton's  Monotones  where all that is needed is a calm ,
	 unhurried and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all its dimensions .  Nevertheless the three dancers in Monotones are Characters in demi - caractre  ballets Literally translated demi - caractre  means half character ,
	 but that gives little understanding of its implications in ballet .  It should describe how the characters ,
	usually non - aristocratic or less educated ,
	If choreographers study the above works of Ashton and MacMillan ,
	 they will understand how far the art of choreography has developed since Fokine changed its structure and texture .  They will perhaps understand even better if they pay particular attention to the fine details of every movement .  It is no longer the case that the romantic style means dancing classically from the feet to the waist and above that allowing the body ,
	arms and head to Definition of Character and National ballet A Character Ballet  is one in which classical technique is discarded except where it is used to depict particular and usually fantastic characters as for the dolls in Petrushka  and La Boutique Fantasque  .  Instead ,
	a particular style of dance is used through which the performers play strongly defined characters who These shapes are built into moving pictures which are inspired by those drawn by Blake to illustrate stories from the Bible .  Because the dancers'  gestures register despair ,

The view that Britain was moving to Prime Ministerial government was largely encouraged by Mrs Thatcher's  dominant personality ,
	 which became more marked following the Falklands war .  But there were other factors as well : her ruthless dismissal of Cabinet dissenters in 1981 and sacking of the Foreign Secretary in 1983 ,

	Snowden In the end Maxse's  impatience with and apparent willingness to consider abandoning established institutions meant that he stretched his Conservative credentials to breaking - point ,
	 and it is important to note that when at his most extreme Maxse was most isolated .  In this sense it was Maxse's  radical Conservatism and not his more dangerous notions that brought him so close to the hub of Conservative politics in the decade before 1914 .  That the views of Edwardian Conservatives elided so easily with those THE DRIFT TOWARDS AUTHORITARIANISM The second facet of continuity from pre - colonial times is the authoritarian nature of most African governments .  In Chapter 3 it was argued that pre - colonial society was indeed authoritarian ,

	 and that the only choice for locals who don't wish to travel is a couple of stetches of canal .  The Nuneaton and Bedworth Council claimed it had received letters of protest from residents opposed to a trial scheme to allow fishing on three lakes in the borough .  Councillors were told anglers spoiled the enjoyment of members of the public who liked to stroll around the lakes ,

	 the inequality within the family develops into slavery which is already  latent in the family .  This stage is reached not just as a result of the increasing complexity of the productive technology ,

	 and an increased division of labour .  The division of labour here is a notion used in part to Formen  ,

	 offers the background to two of the most famous remarks in the whole of Marx's  work .  The first is the remark in Volume I of Capital  that commodity exchange  ( a necessary prerequisite to capitalism )  begins where community life ends .  The second is the statement of a clear evolutionary sequence in the Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy ,
	the work where Marx A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever  existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence .  In any case ,
	 the contradiction which Marx stresses very largely disappears when we realize that it is a matter of the context in which claim to land is expressed .  From the point of view of the outsider the descent group appears as undifferentiated and this will be There are ,

Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for :  they are merely dogmatically asserted .  Given the withering contempt Repair and repointing work was kept to a minimum and new pointing was carefully matched to the colour of the original joints .  Features such as cranes ,

	 which give him the confidence to work as he does ,
	 and promote his work :  The strong tradition of learning ;  the business entrepreneurship of his family ;  the broad philanthropy/charity which hall - marked it ;  and ,
	 lastly ,
	 the self - awareness that comes from being a Cohen  not understood as class - distinction ,
	 but from the high symbolism of the priest and his role .  This latter is particularly interesting .  It was raised by Dudek in somewhat different form when he said that Leonard always had an He ,

	 this earlier privileging of intellect was intimately connected with resistance to nominalism ,
	 and ,
	 in the seventeenth century nominalism triumphed .  The emphasis on the mentality and immateriality of sense experience was associated with the denial that there was anything special about intellect .  Even whilst developing the modern immaterialist notion of consciousness ,
	the eighteenth - century empiricists and others were attacking the dignity of intellect and assimilating it to sensory activity by treating thoughts as mere ( See the discussions of these developments elsewhere in this book ,
	 particularly Chapters 4 and 7 .  )  And it has led to the introduction of new technologies for the direct investigation of the relationships between brain ,

	or producing radiographic So again ,
	 laboratory techniques were affording scientists a glimpse of their subjects'  mental lives .  The brain is not only an electrical machine ,
	 it also has a physical and chemical structure and these too are now being monitored in the living brain .  By using computers to integrate the information from a large number of different viewpoints round the skull ,
	it is possible to visualize the appearance of a slice through the brain and build up a full three - dimensional The viewing medium can be X - rays ,
	 as in computerized tomographic  ( CT )  scans ;  magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei ,
	 as in nuclear magnetic resonance  ( NMR )  scans ;  or emission from radioactively labelled substances incorporated into the structure of nerve cells as in positron emission tomographic  ( PET )  scans .  These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,
	 but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .

The main body of a bit image file consists of data bytes with bit mapping similar to figs 3 to 5 .  Bit Bit image files normally have a fixed format header giving general information about the file and its format .  One way to handle different bit mapping schemes is to include in the header details such as the number of bit planes ,
	 bits per pixel ,
	 pixels per scan line ,
	 and the number of scan lines .  This low level pixel oriented approach obviously makes sense for complex Since data compression relies on redundancy in the information to be compressed ,
	 performance is affected by the nature of the data .  There are various methods which can be used for  computer files  ( see box Getting quarts into pint pots )  .  Run Length Limitation ( RLL ) is probably the most common for bit In the future ,

	 cinema ,
	 visiting the theatre and looking at the actor's  work carefully and analytically .  It is also Of course ,
	 if an actor is doing his/her work well ,

	 Scene 5 )  or Viola's  1 left no ring with her from Twelfth Night   ( Act 2 ,
	 Scene 2 )  may be all too well known to a panel ,

	 1 think ,
	 depend a good deal on your personal taste in theatre at the time you are auditioning .  And your choice of audition piece is often largely decided by the contrast it provides with the classical selection you have made .  The question of accent is Try to think of the essentials ,
	 as any good coach will tell you .  For example ,
	 if you are embarking on Julia in Two Gentlemen of Verona  and her Proteus letter ,
	 it is as well to have a sheet of paper that you can tear up to make the scene start with a dramatic focus and give the lines some action .  Learning thoroughly the piece which you are going to do is Stage nerves are unlike anything else in the whole world ,

	 and both singing and acting tutorials are usually conducted on a one to one basis  ( more on tutorials in chapter 7 )  .  Of course the student also needs to learn how to co - ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary actions and movements which are part of the natural traffic of performance ,
	 and learn about prop handling .  Classes help the actor to gain confidence in dealing with many things happening at the same time ,
	and this is an Small ,
	 little - known groups don't generally muster a large audience ,
	 of course ,
	 but they are often a good way of commanding interest from future employers .  Certainly the new actor should never remain idle but create chances wherever possible .  This may sound like cold comfort when you're desperately hoping for something to come along and get you going but continuing your work and maintaining skills is vitally The new actor is generally operating in top gear and if this momentum is stopped it can be very damaging to the morale and can result in an actor's  technical skills going rusty  something to be avoided at all costs .  To speak of further training programmes now may sound like a mere desperate remedy ,
	 but it doesn't mean anything as arduous or as expensive as the full training of your drama school .

We had next to none when I was at drama school and young actors need to know more about what will be expected of them on film sets and television studios .

	 and had a prime obligation to push for a public morality which matched its perception of the natural law lest the very fabric of society be torn asunder and its members cast on the road of moral decline .  What was good for catholics was also good for protestants ,

	 teleologically construed ,
	 can make a great deal of difference :  in effect a difference of degree can be as real as  a difference of kind but in a different way :  the lesser is inferior and thereby inimical in a way the antithetical cannot be ,
	 and the same becomes more ditferent than difference itself .  But never utterly  i.e. securely  other  .  Perhaps this helps explain something Rainoldes apart ,

	 rendered the theatrical self - consciousness surrounding transvestism complex and shifting ;  it provoked questions teasingly unanswerable :  for example  and this is a question which remains intriguing for us today  which ,
	 or how many ,
	 of the several gender identities embodied in any one figure are in play at any one time ?  There were factors at play in the association of theatrical cross - dressing and sexual transgressions .  Not only did prostitutes frequent the theatre ,
	but the street transvestite was sometimes associated with prostitution and possibly sodomy : Henriques The final report of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth drew attention to the stability in the distribution of income in the post - war period .  Some redistribution had occurred between 1938 and 1949 ,
	 but if one ignores the top 1 per cent of income earners ,
	 there had been little change up to 1979 .  Under the Conservative government ,
	as One tactic she has used is to decide matters outside the formal Cabinet ,
	 either in committees or in informal groups .  She also exploited her control of the agenda of Cabinet and powers to appoint members of Cabinet committees or groups and draw up their terms of reference .  The appointment of supporters on the Cabinet committee dealing with economic strategy has already been Mrs Thatcher's  governments were determined to cut the unions down in size and ,
	 for all the incremental nature of the legislation ,
	 prepared the ground in advance .  Class analysis alone is inadequate for an understanding of the policies of Thatcherism ,
	 for it has also disturbed a number of middle - class interests .  The ending of the monopoly of solicitors over house sales conveyancing and of opticians over the sale of spectacles has already been If they are  including public - sector trade unions ,
	 local government ,
	 local authority schools and housing ,

	 City Technology Colleges ,
	 and for schools and hospitals to opt out ;  inducements for universities to be less dependent on state finance ;  promotion of council house sales and housing action trusts .  It is also interesting to At the same time Beaverbrook told the House of Lords of Britain's  willingness to attend an international conference on civil aviation .  Aware of American dislike of centralized control ,
	 he confined his remarks to generalities about open trade welding nations together for mutual benefit .  As These stages were based on productive technology .  For example ,
	 hunters and gatherers were placed low while irrigating cultivators were placed high ,
	 then these activities were linked directly with such institutions as rules concerning property ,
	 the status of women ,
	 the type of government ,
	 and the kinship system .  In this ,
	Ancient Society resembled the other evolutionary schemes for the history of mankind which we have just Anthropology and the work of Morgan were harnessed to the political task of rewriting history .  There was another political task to which anthropology was put in the work of Marx ,
	 and for this the writings of Morgan also proved particularly appropriate .  The use of anthropology which we have already This second and logically distinct ,
	 rhetorical use of anthropological material is never completely separate from the historical use ,
	 and the mixture of the two became ,
	 as we shall see ,
	 the source of many problems .  The rhetorical use of anthropology inevitably involved Marx and Engels in a search of the anthropological literature for examples  of opposites to the institutions of capitalism .  Since their work focused on certain topics it was natural that they particularly looked for evidence relating to these topics ,
	and as examples of the rhetorical use of anthropology three such central topics can be According to the theory ,
	 the people who used such a system of terms did not themselves ,
	 however ,
	 practise such a type of marriage but actually practices the next stage .  This was because according to Morgan kin terms lag behind .  As a result ,
	the evidence for this second stage in the history of marriage depends entirely on the two assumptions which we have already Engels re - echoes The German Ideology  in showing that far from the State being the repository of justice ,
	 it is the repository of exploitation ,
	 but here he does this by use of genuine anthropological materials .  According to Engels the State only develops with the full elaboration of classes ,
	 and it is the tool of the ruling class enforcing its will on those whom it oppresses .  This is a crucial proposition which we have already Admittedly if the component family abandons its claim to the land this will revert to the commonality but that does not mean that there are no such claims in normal circumstances .  In other words ,
	 a declaration of common ownership of the land of the gens does not imply free and equal access to all within the gens .  Marx ,
	in particular ,
	had already Finally ,
	 since there is no simple correlation between high status for women and matriliny and since there is no simple connection between matriliny and type of technology ,
	 it follows that there is no simple connection between primitive technology and high status for women .  Among living hunters and gatherers ,
	 women may have a comparatively high status as amongst the Mbuti of Africa ,
	 or a comparatively low status among most Australian Aborigines The issue is far more complicated and it is only fair to In November 1965 we accepted the spartan layout with good grace :  Climbing into the cockpit ,
	 one recalls vivid memories of the old Ace ,

In Scotland the white edition of the Evening News  competed with the green - of the Evening Citizen  and the pink of the Evening Times  .  On late Saturday afternoons ,
	at the corner the kerb is covered with men who stand with their backs to the light ,
	intently reading in a pink newspaper full of poetical reporting and results The popular daily press in the Edwardian years began to give quite a prominent place to sport .  The sports page at the back of the paper established itself ,

Wexford had seen that glass and teak lamp in a Kingsmarkham shop and The release of growth hormone  ( fig 3.2 )  is dominated by external factors rather than the body clock and is linked to the electrical changes in the brain associated with deep sleep .  This is normally found in the first part of sleep  ( see below )  .  It is interesting to It is because at this time the warning light is more easily visible in the twilight than in the daylight .  So this external factor offsets the fact that performance in the evening due to the body clock might be deteriorating .  It will be In some cases of endogenous depression there was one symptom which suggested that an abnormality of the internal clock might exist .  It was where depression was most marked in the morning and decreased during the course of the day .  It was also Between the two aircraft we can now see all of our target area .  As we are studying the area ,

	words of parents and friends ,
	however ,
	that the real achievement of training can be Even where a bituminous felt layer was laid on top of the boarding ,
	 this form of construction is likely to compound problems of rainwater penetration once a gap appears in the roof covering because the water which enters ,
	 instead of draining out of the construction at the eaves ,
	 settles on the upper edges of the local slate - fixing battens ,
	 inducing rot both in them and the boarding .  Equally bad from the point of view of damp exclusion in the circumstance of a breach appearing in the roof surface ,
	 and even worse in terms of the restrictions it places on the opportunities for salvaging slates in any wholesale reconditioning of the roof covering ,
	 is the arrangement in which the slates are nailed directly to boarding ,
	 no fixing battens having been incorporated .  If this form of construction cannot be identified from an inspection of voids in the roof surface made from the exterior ,
	it may be possible to deduce whether or not it applies by However ,
	 less significant defects are often readily identified .  These include delamination of wrought iron which arises with corrosion ,
	 owed to the presence of slag in the material between layers of almost pure iron .  Also ,

	 little provision would be made for these animals ,
	 but there would be one or more barns ,
	 stables and shelters for carts .  On a mixed farm ,
	 there would be a larger number of buildings for cattle ,
	 while on a pastoral farm the reduced need for waggon horses caused the stables to be small and there would be little accommodation for crops .  It is interesting to It used to be the normal practice to adapt buildings for different purposes over their lives .  Evidence of the logical development of this practice can also be found in one ow two early industrial buildings .  At least one small nineteenth - century factory in Dentorn ,

	 it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,

ANTHROPOLOGY FOR THE POLICE It seems relevant that anthropology be used at this time to contribute to the debate on policing ,

	the In 1979 ,
	 James Anderton ,
	 the Christian moralist chief constable of Greater Manchester ,
	 described the greatest threat to law and order as stemming from seditionist interested groups who do not have the well - being of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy  ( Thompson 1979 :  380 )  .  In the light of such a polemic stand ,
	 it begs the question whether the revelation of how crime figures are manipulated by the police to sustain institutional beliefs  ( see Chapter 5 )  could be said to undermine democracy or be classified as sedition .  For Anderton vehemently rejects the idea of any internal evaluation which might explore the moralities or philosophies of policing : there is simply no room in the management and Such people are radically opposed to the idea of sociologists conducting research on the police and long for a return to a golden age when the proverbial veil of secrecy surrounded police work .  When the research is experiential ,
	 carried out by an insider ,
	 the publications can prove emotive and will almost certainly be career - problematic for the author .  Usually policemen know the limits allowed by the all totalitarian institutions  ( in Goffman's  phrase )  embody their principles in an inexplicit way ,

	 and for whom as Bourdieu  ( ibid .  )  indicates ,
	 such challenges would defy the most natural manifestations of submission to the established order and abolish lateral possibilities .  In consequence of this acquired system of generative schemes ,

A shef The arrogance of Bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpires from other criticisms directed against younger visitors .  But peasants also complained when what they called doctors came out to inspect their cattle and sanitary arrangements ,

	 leading to economic and social tensions at the lower levels .  Right from its inception NEP carried within itself the germs of its own fatal illness ,
	whether one looks at its fiscal When the Soviet sent the militia to the colony in order to accuse the inmates of robbing peasants ,
	 Makarenko sent even it packing .  He showed the same scant respect for other agents of central power .  His opinion of the local Komsomol was no doubt coloured by the fact that his own colony was a kind of rival They were far too interested in girls and vodka ,
	 and they had a rather negative influence on the colonists .  Soviet historians have subsequently tried to cover over this situation .  They have written that It is well known that the great Soviet pedagogue ,
	A. S. Makarenko ,
	succeeded in forming a genuine Soviet collective of charges only after a Komsomol Yet we cannot take foreign accounts at their face value either .  Political propaganda on the part of the American Relief Administration ,
	 by far the longest foreign source of aid ,
	 warped its judgement at the time ,
	 and the subsequent polarization of Russian - American relations has not improved the objectivity of later scholarly accounts of the Famine as seen through American eyes .  Even F. Nansen ,

Soviet and foreign relief At this point we can embark on an investigation of the spatial or horizontal effects of the Famine in 1922 .  Internal movement within the worst - affected areas should be looked at first .  Those peasants who continued to own draught animals had lent them to relief In other ways positive help could be given by more fortunate regions .  Indeed M. I. Kalinin ,

	 the central authorities took no action throughout 1922 .   At both guberniia and central levels the Soviet government established a liaison system between their own plenipotentiaries and all foreign relief Certainly suspect committee members had attempted to go abroad ,
	 but the real reason was probably that the committee had served its purpose by acting as a bait to attract foreign relief organizations  ( the ARA drew up an agreement on 20 August )  .  Alternatively the committee could have served as a scapegoat if Pomgol activities had failed completely .  Since all foreign relief Gosplan and other central economic organs from 1921 on had accumulated on paper a number of plans for reconstruction which they were now eager to realize .  As in the recent past ,
	 and as was to be the case with much greater frequency after the start of the Five - Year Plans ,
	 planners in Moscow drew up neat and rather abstract formulations that did not match up closely with local realities and timings .  Foreign relief This move at least gave greater financial stability .  Between 15 October 1922 and 1 August 1923 ,
	 for example ,
	 it received 719,502 gold roubles from the tax in kind  ( its highest source of income was 1,344,639 roubles from church treasures )  .  When in September 1922 the ARA discovered that the Soviet government intended to export grain in considerable quantities ,
	most foreign relief Non - Russian papers were left to local military supervision until the end of Civil War ,
	 and largely to their own devices throughout 1922 ,
	 unless they exhibited blatant defiance of high political directives ,
	 as in the case of Georgia .  This did not necessarily mean that all local party chiefs in the minorities were also lethargic during 1922 .  We know from the Smolensk archive that the guberniia committee in the winter of 19223 convened meetings of many local But the task was increasingly beyond them ,
	 as social surveys showed the inability of the welfare services to cope with the specific needs of  the aged ,
	 the disabled ,
	 and one - parent families .  Divorces rose steadily ,
	 though the real acceleration in the divorce rate was to come after the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act of 1 984 which allowed petitioning for divorce after only one year of marriage .  Especially disadvantaged were children ,

	 Americans ,
	 the British by this crude test were a relatively happy people .  Their democracy had remained secure .  Suggestions in 1975 of a military coup by Colonel Stirling's non - party ,
	non - class Ramsey made a speech which disconcerted the managers of the conference ,
	 who thought it a bad example of English insularity .  The speech led to a quarrel ,
	 soon patched up ,
	 with the general secretary Visser t'Hooft .  The meeting at Evanston clinched the sense of scepticism which Ramsey felt ,

	 such as that at Kelham where he himself participated or that seventeenth - century community of Little Gidding which he was later to celebrate .  Yet he saw the danger in making these communities an ideal ,
	 as he turned an anthropological eye on Christianity and perceived that such examples seem to proffer no solution to industrial urban and suburban existence  the way most people live .  Such a religious patterning of small communities reveals a Christendom fixed at the state of development suitable to a simple agricultural and piscatorial society ,
	and so imperfectly suited to the more complicated The attempt to locate libertarian Conservatism in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century seems implausible .  Eccleshall appears to be on stronger ground when he looks to the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries for evidence of libertarian Conservatism .  Here he finds If disputes within the party over policy and doctrine were one symptom of Conservative confusion ,
	 another was the legion of leagues which appeared in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ,
	 when it seemed that hardly a year went by without the founding of some new right - wing association .  The main aim of Franz Coetzee's  intriguing study For Party or Country  is to explain this phenomenon through an examination of the outlook and activities of three of the larger groups :  the Navy League  ( NL )  ,
	 the Tariff Reform League  ( TRL )  ,
	 and the Anti - Socialist Union  ( ASU )  .  In terms of the history of these He examines their foundation ,
	 their funding ,
	 their social constituency ,
	 and their organizational structure in detail ,
	 and in the process disposes of a number of myths and conventional wisdoms .  For example ,
	 Cortzee shows that contemporary tales of the tariff reform millions ,
	 are not borne out by the relatively impoverished state of the Tariff Reform  League ,
	 and he demonstrates that the variety of industries and economic activities which were represented in the TRL defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of its interest base .  On issues like this Coetzee's sensitivity and grasp of detail are shown to good effect : but with regard to the broader historical significance of these First ,
	 it caused the groups some significant problems .  The NL especially suffered a major split because of its refusal after 1906 to endorse Conservative candidates .  The rival ,
	splinter That there should have been a Navy League ,
	 a Tariff Reform League ,
	 and an Anti - Socialist Union filled with Conservatives was an indication that there were many Conservative supporters who felt that the Conservative party was not doing its job properly .  There were occasions when the leagues were of great help to the Conservatives ,
	 but their relationship to the party was often ambivalent and sometimes hostile ,
	 and it was not always easy to control their activities .  It is one of the many strengths of Coetzee's work that he recognizes the disruptive potential of the new In so far as Whitehall had considered these matters it had been vaguely assumed that a status quo ante  would be established and the Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies ,
	 the French in Indochina ,
	 and the Colonial Office in Burma and Malaya would resume their rightful sway .  The Americans had different views ,
	 but they had deliberately distanced themselves from the area .  Only gradually did it dawn on those responsible that vigorous and determined nationalist The problem of servicing debt is already ,
	 in practice ,
	 less severe than it was in the early and mid 1980s .  Relaxation of the international cold war has meant that military intervention by powerful countries from either the western or eastern blocs  from Cuba to France  will be much less frequent .  Even South Africa may decide that the returns from supporting such First of all society ,
	 as distinct from the State ,
	 had to be isolated and analysed ,
	 and secondly an attempt had to be made at understanding the evolution of society ,
	 since only then would it be possible to understand under what circumstances the State evolved and what its historical significance was .  These were the tasks first attempted in The German Ideology  .  The first task consisted of formulating a view of society which was based on principles different from the traditional ones ,
	according to which societies could be typified in terms of their administrative The first task consisted of formulating a view of society which was based on principles different from the traditional ones ,
	 according to which societies could be typified in terms of their administrative organization by using such terms as democracy or monarchy .  If we talked of society in these terms ,
	 Marx argued ,
	 we could never appreciate that the phenomena to which the terms referred were themselves only the product of a more fundamental social process .  In order to bypass this traditional way of seeing society ,
	Marx turned away from administrative and political While with the ancient city state there was a unity between town and country ,
	 since country settlements were really extensions of the city both in the type of economic activity which took place there and in the principles of social organization in the two places ,
	 this was not so under feudalism .  The difference led to an important conflict between town and country .  At first the freemen of both town and country had an This Engels does by showing that the Greek and Roman states ,
	 the sacred sources of the European ideal ,
	 were based on principles which can also be seen in embryo among  much less prestigious peoples ,
	 the American Indians .  This is dealt with in Chapters 3 ,
	 4 ,
	 5 ,
	 and 6 .  The third part of Engels's discussion explains why ,
	in spite of the presence of the State in medieval Europe ,
	some islands of communal The second part of this second half of The Origin  deals with Greece and Rome and in many ways again follows what Marx and Engels had written previously .  What is new however is the suggestion ,
	 which at the time of writing must have appeared as the height of impertinence ,
	 that the Greek and Roman states originated in much the same kind of confederation as the Iroquois .  In this way Engels asserts the generality of the principles discussed ,
	but also he explains the importance of what he believed were remains of gentile principles in the ( He does admit however that these remains were  in historical times at least  linked to patrilineal groups ;  rather odd inheritors of the principles of the matrilineal gens .  )  Two other general points also emerge from the discussion of Greece and Rome .  The first is that it shows well the distinction Engels makes between general principles in this case the dissolution of communal The communal and the familial are not necessarily in opposition  they are matters of levels ,
	 and although at certain times Marx seems to see this ,
	 at others he does not and Engels never does .  This is because of their legitimate keenness to stress the presence of a communal principle in the history of mankind .  None the less the fact remains that the presence of descent groups tells us nothing directly about domestic As we saw ,
	 most modern anthropologists would ,
	 like Morgan ,
	 stress the corporate character of descent groups and would agree that these groups cannot be understood as large families Fortes ,
	 1953 ,
	 but they would also stress that some kind of individual domestic unit seems to normally exist in societies with descent groups .  In certain other ways Morgan misled Marx and Engels more irredeemably .  Morgan believed that the only true descent groups were matrilineal ,
	and that matrilineal descent groups gens were fundamentally different in In patrilineal descent groups ,
	 he argued ,
	 the individual family and  private property were prominent and the communal principle already moribund .  In fact ,
	 there seems no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal groups in this respect .  What matters ,
	as Morgan ,
	Marx ,
	and Engels rightly stress ,
	is the corporate The various Dayak societies of Borneo are an example .  This greater variety than that envisaged by Morgan or Engels does certainly modify the picture .  On the whole ,

	 was evidence of the power building up behind the green movement in the 1980s and 1990s .  There is an obvious danger of excessive duplication when broadly similar There are informal networks through which we let one another know what we are doing and we meet and talk .  For instance ,
	 Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth had ten people each at a meeting recently  ( towards the end of 1989 )  to talk about the Green Bill and other issues .  Ad hoc alliances of green Nearly one - third of the citizens of Leningrad are said to suffer from diseases the upper respiratory tract as a result of atmospheric pollution .  On the credit side ,
	 it should be said that there is now an acute awareness in the Soviet Union and the East European countries that pollution is a social and political issue and not just something that can be categorized vaguely as an environmental problem and shoved to the debit side of progress .  Miners have struck in the Soviet Union over pollution ( in combination with other matters ) and scores of green The historic Board of Admiralty ,
	 Army Council ,
	 and Air Council were downgraded to become the Admiralty ,
	 Army ,
	  and Air Boards .  And the whole of the new organization was co - located in the former Air Ministry/Board of Trade building on the south side of Whitehall ,
	 where it is today .  Many people felt that the Thorneycroft/Mountbatten reorganization did not go far enough ,
	and that Service Departments should have been abolished and a completely functional Similarly ,
	 although anything that exists is particular and individual ,
	 we can have general ideas .  On the basis of our ideas of particular men ,
	 we can form a general idea of man ,
	 and by abstracting differences from the ideas of man ,
	 horse ,
	 and lion ,
	 we can form still more general ideas ,
	 such as that of animal .  The fourth part of Gassendi's Logic has to do with the Given this and various of his examples ,
	 such as triangle or procession ,
	 they seem to be ways in which the substances on which they depend may be ordered ,

	but a certain The CPRS had been set up by Ted Heath to advise on long - term policy issues .  Its first director was Lord Rothschild and its staff was drawn both from the civil service and from outside Whitehall .  The tank had been continued by the succeeding Labour Government during which they carried out their famous inquiry into the Foreign Office which proposed fundamental changes in the The health service does not have a monopoly in cleaning ,
	 catering and laundry skills in the same way that it does in the skills required to treat sick people .  There are private companies who specialize in these services and who ,

	 also have dedicated people working for them .  In February 1983 I announced in the House of Commons that health authorities should put their ancillary services out to tender to see whether they would get best value from private or in - house He did not want to miss a word .

	 Married Love and Wise Parenthood may have sold widely in the early 1920s but the main readers were almost certainly the middle class .  Richard Allan Soloway's  excellent study of the birth control movement between 1870 and 1930 may well reveal the extent to which these groups were concerned about the need to spread knowledge about birth control amongst the working classes but ,
	 it would seem ,
	 in the light of more recent research ,
	 that such concern was inappropriate .  Soloway's comment that ,
	The birth control groups found it difficult to persuade the middle and upper - class membership of the feminist much fuller use can be made of the machinery for joint consultation and negotiation between employers and employed .  It is more than doubtful whether we have seen the fullest possible development of machinery for joint consultation in particular industries .  And practically nothing has been done to establish effective machinery of joint conference between the representative Ross McKibbin and Bernard Barker feel that the Labour Party was making determined efforts to improve both its national and local organization and that ,
	 despite some obvious difficulties ,
	 it succeeded in doing so .  McKibbin ,
	 in particular ,
	 acknowledges the strengths and weaknesses of the new constituency and party organizations but stresses the overall general improvements which were achieved .  To him ,
	however ,
	the overriding developments were the increasing centralization of party Yet ,
	 although Britain suffered severe economic depression and rising unemployment ,
	 her economic plight was much less marked than that of Germany and Italy .  Perhaps for this reason Britain experienced little in the way of a fascist movement in the 1920s ;  only a few small and insignificant fascist groups ,
	 hostile to the Bolsheviks or the Jews ,
	 emerged at that time .  It was not until the 1930s that a more effective fascist Neither proposition is necessarily correct .  The Labour Party subsequently achieved some measure of socialism under Attlee ,
	 despite the hostility of capitalism ,
	 and the Labour Party was well informed about the real strength of the fascist challenge .  Quite rightly ,
	the Labour Party did not wish to exaggerate the importance of a fringe political group which it had investigated in a detailed national survey ,
	based upon a circular to the secretaries of its constituency After the conference ,
	 the Socialist League continued to oppose rearmament ,
	 opposed sanctions against Italy threatened as a result of the Italian invasion of Abyssinia ,
	 and advocated a policy for the Labour movement of preparing for the mass resistance to war ,
	 by which was meant a general strike .  In January 1937 it patched together a new united front campaign in association with the ILP ,
	 the Communists ,
	 the Left Book Club and Tribune ,
	 around a programme of defence for the Spanish Republic ,
	 opposition to rearmament by the National government ,
	 support for the struggles of the unemployed and the affiliation of the Communist Party and the ILP to the Labour Party. The campaign was in defiance of the Labour Party ban on joint work with the Communists and the Socialist League was condemned by the party ,
	its members being forced to choose between disbanding the The size and range of the relief activities undertaken shows the strength of public support for the Spanish Republican government .  At the national level there was a National Joint Council for Spanish Relief ,
	 chaired by the Duchess of Atholl ,
	 a Conservative MP ,
	 though dominated by Liberal and Labour .  This committee acted as the co - ordinator for the activities of many other About 7 million was being spent annually on pushing the claims of washing powders such as Tide ,

	 Which  ?  and its laboratories revealed that the cleaning power of these rivals was practically identical .  Though they fell far short of the giant - killing exploits of Citizen Ralph Nader in the decade to come ,
	the consumers' The House Committee published a cumulative index of names and organizations and there was the Attorney General's  list of about two hundred organizations which were considered to have been Communist or Communist Front .  These included such subversive bodies as wartime committees for Soviet - American friendship or for Russian War Relief .  Two ex - FBI men ,
	Vincent Hartnett and Theodore Kirkpatrick ,
	compiled a handy compendium in book form of members of these dangerous Larry Adler was blacklisted as a performer throughout the Fifties .  Even as a harmonica player he had to come to England to get work .  Adler recalls : I was listed in Red Channels for being associated with eight The more militant Protestants saw this as a weakness ,
	 a lack of will on the part of the government .  It was now illegal to be a Protestant in a Protestant country .  The result was periodic clashes between the government and The city council planned to call it the Queen Elizabeth Bridge but the more assertive Protestants wanted a memorial to Lord Carson .  So angry was Ian Paisley at the affront to Carson's  memory that he increased his tirade of abuse against O'Neill ,
	 produced Carson's  son to  contest the Westminster elections in March  ( promising four Protestant Unionists in all )  and only withdrew when he realised how devoid of constituency organisation he then was .  The rudiments of a constituency It is important to note that it was only the statements of this man and his wife which contained any evidence of Paisley's  knowledge of the crimes ,
	 and the juries determined that they were not trustworthy witnesses .  The view of Paisley's  critics was that he was implicated but was clever enough to avoid any direct contact .  Others maintained that ,
	even if he knew nothing of these crimes ,
	he was morally responsible in that he had contributed substantially to the general climate which allowed members of his In their view ,
	 the old party had been doing well .  It now had members in Stormont and increasing popular support and ,
	 more importantly ,
	 it had a clear Protestant  identity .  In many areas ,
	it took the full weight of Paisley's authority ,
	exercised either directly or through loyal supporters such as Gordon Cooke ,
	then chairman of the North Antrim branch ,
	to persuade the Protestant Unionists to dissolve in favour of the new When the DUP was being planned in late 1971 ,
	 Desmond Boal kept pushing Unionists such as Austin Ardill to join the new party and received assurances from him and a number of others that they would join .  It was only their reluctance to abandon their own party which prevented the creation of a mass anti - appeasement party .  At a number of times since ,
	there has been a genuine willingness among some of the DUP members of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition to merge their party into a new wider In order to ensure that the Catholic population won at least one of the three seats allocated to Northern Ireland ,
	 the whole of the province was treated as one constituency with three members .  The election could hardly have been better designed to promote the DUP .  Although Robinson and others were achieving success in building a province - wide In order to do this ,
	 Jerry Falwell and the other Baptist pastors in the movement have to operate with almost watertight compartments for ,
	 on the one hand ,
	 their religion  ( in this box Catholics and Jews are doomed sinners )  ,
	 and on the other ,
	 their politics  ( we are all part of a shared Judeo - Christian tradition )  .  That sort of compartmentalization has been roundly denounced by Bob Jones University and those sections of American fundamentalism with which Paisley is most at home but we will never know if his religio - political system would permit such pragmatism because the constitutional issue so overrides everything else in Northern Ireland that there is no expectation or need for him to work with conservative Catholics .  This does not mean that Paisley would not be glad of the support ( such as he had in his campaign to Save Ulster From Sodomy ) of individual Catholics ,
	but he would not work with Catholic Nevertheless they were considerably more evangelical at the turn of the century than they are now .  The problem for the Free Presbyterians is that the fraternal orders have always seen themselves as linking the broad Protestant religious tradition with the main unionist party ,
	 hence the common arrangement of Orange Lodges holding their annual church parades at each of the Church of Ireland ,
	 Presbyterian ,
	 and Methodist churches in turn .  As the main churches have become more liberal ,
	Free Presbyterianism emerged to challenge the lack of real Protestantism and hence offered an implicit challenge to the fraternal A third Free Presbyterian minister said :  Perhaps the main reason for leaving the Orange Order was that in 1969 I was saved by the grace of God and therefore felt that I could not sit and be associated with members of the Orange and Black while they consumed alcohol in their meetings on the 12th and 13th mornings each July .   Given the Free Presbyterian Church's  high political profile one would expect that many of its ministers would be active in the Orange Lodge ,
	 Black Preceptory ,
	 and Apprentice Boys .  Of forty - four ministers whose affiliations are known ,
	twenty - one have never been members of any fraternal Three have been members of the Independent Orange Order and one has resigned .  Ten ministers are known to be members of the Apprentice Boys of Derry .  It would be easy to exaggerate the extent to which the lack of genuine evangelicalism in the fraternal This is even more the case since the Anglo - Irish accord of November 1985 which clearly represents the British government's  view that solutions to the Northern Ireland problem require the active involvement of the Dublin government .  For the DUP to embrace this accord and attempt to make it work would be for it to abandon its opposition to anything which presages a united Ireland .  It is usually the case that those things which best suit the Michels model are social movement"

Inspectors can no longer hide behind a Certainly the social sciences are seen to be the arbiters of revolutionary change which might somehow dismantle the police institution and its processes ,

	 I don't want to seem disloyal ,

	 links silence to other concepts of respect for the order of the institution .  In consequence ,

As it is ,

The college should have as its prime concern the nurture of ethics and integrity ;  they are the core of any professions .  Such a proposal is now of another era ,

Any internal disciplinary measure to contain such an account is much less likely to become of public concern in the way that the Clive Ponting or the Cathy Massiter prosecutions became notorious causes clbres  .  As a result of this all pervading desire for reticence it is possible to suggest that the presentation of research Our lists contained the names of the family prigs we knew were professional thieves and burglars ;  and of whom I was advised on my arrival in the department by an old detective :  you only get one chance a year to nail these bastards if you are lucky ,

	 but without the genuinely class - based politics one finds in other European countries .  The party structure followed was based on the Irish civil war antagonism of 19223 ,
	 with the pro - Treaty party more or less in power until the anti - Treaty party entered politics in 1930 .  However ,
	both sides developed a centralized The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland .  They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist parties ,
	 Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party ,
	 though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism .  Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two The Workers'  Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border .  The provisional movement is divided on the issue of capitalism but ,
	 for  the time at least ,
	 has an openly declared policy of achieving an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process .  The SDLP ,
	still the main But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization ,
	 much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists ,
	 which always appeared total on the issue of incorporation into a united ,
	 independent Ireland .  It was only with the Troubles ,
	 from 1968 ,
	 that unionists  broke ranks .  Yet ,
	despite the splintering ,
	they have succeeded in allying the present two main The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland ,
	 formed at the time of the abolition of the Stormont parliament ,
	 represents those catholics ,
	 protestants ,
	 and others who disavow the twin alliance of Ireland but retain at least a practical attitude on sovereignty .  They prefer British to Irish rule and seem unlikely to move from that position .  While the It also set up its own scouting organizations ,
	 clubs both sporting and social ,
	 with Irish music ,
	 Irish dancing ,
	 and Irish or Gaelic games .  These games were and still are much loathed by the majority within the Northern protestant community .  Priests continued to act as sponsors of the local catholic nationalist political structure ,
	chairing meetings of the Conditioned by church canon law ,
	 participation by clerics in politics was forbidden .  But at the same time ,
	 an enormous sense of responsibility to protect the church ,
	 the family ,
	 and the minds and hearts of the faithful from incursions by the state was perceived to be the basic duty of the church leaders .  The leadership of the state knew in large measure what was wanted : it was part of the national popular consciousness as well as being itself a result of the convention between church and Irish parliamentary We aim to show in Chapter 5 that this blindness was in part promoted by the religious elements in their beliefs .  Secondly ,
	 there is the problem of the Northern catholic community ,
	 which tends to be taken as a monolithic nationalist community .  Apart from the fact that there has been significant support for the alliance This indicates an acceptance of the state structures ,
	 or a recognition of a need for the separation of Northern Ireland from the remaining state structure of Ireland ,
	 but at the same time a continuing opposition to protestant  loyalist dominance .  One can also add that there is something in the present policies of the SDLP which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question .  Seamus Mallon ,
	MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland ,
	but some of his co - politicians in the The truth of the matter probably lies somewhere in between .  As Miller argues ,
	 there is a long tradition among the protestants of Ulster of viewing the British state ambiguously .  It is clear that in the past many of them have considered loyalty to be a two - way process ,
	a contract or covenant ,
	and that the state could be a traitorous Though the republicans lost the war ,
	 they eventually won their case with their successful introduction of the republican constitution of 1937 .  This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,
	 furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development ,
	the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,
	the original republicans developing a populist ,
	nationalist This shows the extent to which the republican ideal gained ground once independence was in place ,
	 furthering the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism .  Despite this development ,
	 the struggle between the two previously warring factions has continued ,
	 the original republicans developing a populist ,
	 nationalist party ,
	 and the former treaty party developing a concern with law and order ,
	 and moderation on the national question .  But the fight did not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of Ireland ,
	as nationalist From 1911 to 1914 ,
	 the Irish high clergy made successive attacks on the trade union movement and on socialism .  Rumpf and Hepburn  ( 1977 )  view the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limiting the appeal of socialism for the Irish subordinate classes until the 1950s .  The emergence of a new pro - capitalist The decline of the labour element in the SDLP in the North ,
	 however ,
	 does indicate a trend to the style of politics in the Republic ,
	 that is towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance .  The national question as such still remains a central preoccupation for catholic nationalists .  Because the nation is seen as only partially liberated ,
	and particularly by the membership of the largest The dual source of the state's  role in hegemony helps us understand the limitations of the state in respect of the alliance whose power it also represents .  This is why collections by the provisionals in public houses were having partial success in the  1970s without too much interference by the Garda ,
	 the Republic's  police force .  The collections indicated a wider hidden culture of support for the lads who were at the forefront of the battle to restore national unity ,
	in addition to the much smaller There can be no doubt that the lack of such a programme bore heavily upon the poor ,
	 and that poor health and mortalities were a consequence .  In 1946 there were already signs of clerical opposition to any socialization of welfare in queries about Fianna Fil's  proposals from Archbishop McQuaid and the Confederation of Convent Schools .  As has already been seen ,
	it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known ,
	which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade ,
	but one which it was felt by both interested The next significant event of constitutional relevance was the important initiative taken by the nationalist parties in Ireland in 19834 ,
	 the New Ireland Forum .  This was an initiative sponsored by the SDLP at first intended to bring together politicians from both catholic  nationalist and protestant  loyalist groups to discuss the future of the island as a whole .  In reality only the major nationalist The new Ireland must be a society within which ,
	 subject only to public order ,
	 all cultural ,
	 political and religious beliefs can be freely expressed and practised .  This was made explicit in terms of the sense of British identity which protestant loyalists experience :  This implies in particular ,

	 and artists and sculptors were in various ways affected by the demonstration of its realisation in the theatre built for the composer at Bayreuth .  The collaboration of artists with the stage was also brought to a high point by Serge Diaghilev ,
	 in his commissions to artists for the Russian Ballet .  This connection between painting and the theatre was important to earlier European art in religious as well as secular Clearly artists working in several media have a wide range of references .  The art critic is thus bound to consider with care what standards of comparison should be used .  In the late twentieth century artists working in But if Roth dissents from the statement ,
	 then imagining how he came to write most of his books becomes a problem .  Zuckerman tells his Maria :  Being Zuckerman is one long The man upstairs ,

Zuckerman says here that But Roth must know that it is likely to be no joke to those who are reading his book .  Zuckerman says here that performance is all there is ,
	 that person and persona are one .  But we may feel on reading this that it takes two to perform that When we turn to the theatre the question of scale is also significant .  The theatre is larger than life ,
	 not in terms of physical scale ,
	 but because movements and speech are comparatively emphatic and intense ,
	 even when a play simulates everyday natural surroundings .  Some people find this makes theatre less believable less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained Some people find this makes theatre less believable  less true to their own experience and therefore less convincing than the more restrained performances seen on television and cinema .  Theatre invites you to give your full attention to what is happening on stage  the theatrical experience is a very concentrated one and you as a member of the audience are vitally connected to what is going on .  As part of the audience you are as much a part of the entertainment as the So ,
	 what can you learn from looking so closely at the actor on stage ,
	 TV and cinema ?  In the first place you will start to think about how an actor's  work differs according to the demands of the medium .  And you will become aware of technical skills noticing economy of effect and style ,
	seeing and hearing how an actor interprets a script ,
	and how his thinking comes across in a But you may not actually learn  much ,
	 simply because the main object of the group will not be to help you but to get on and do the play ,
	 relying on the skills available and hoping that the audience will give adequate support .  So what else can you do ?  In recent years the amateur actor has had more opportunity for classes in theatre work ,
	including voice and movement training as well as But when you are looking for a suitable speech you can't really reject anything familiar solely because you think it might bore the panel .  It's  true that extracts such as Phoebe's  Think not that I love him from As You Like It   ( Act 3 ,
	 Scene 5 )  or Viola's  1 left no ring with her from Twelfth Night   ( Act 2 ,
	 Scene 2 )  may be all too well known to a panel ,
	 but I cannot agree with an adjudication policy that would ban these pieces from the audition .  The selection is right if it truly works for the competing student ,
	and it is the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the What you will eventually be working towards is a fusion of instinct and technique ,
	 and training is very largely to do with improving technical skills .  At drama school ,
	 there is constant attention to a student's  control of both voice and movement ,
	 and the different departments work at developing a student's  overall acting technique .  The emphasis will be on developing an actor's mental and physical concentration ,
	and giving him/her sufficient craftsmanship to sustain a Most classes last for an hour or perhaps an hour and a half .  In the first term ,
	 rehearsals for the production project will usually be around two hours in length ,
	 but progressively more time will be spent on this aspect of the course as the student advances .  Ideally the classes support the work done on the production project and it is particularly valuable if there is strong liaison between voice and movement tutors with the director of a project not least in helping students see how the instructional classes connect with their own And a trained singing voice is undoubtedly a valued asset  there may well be some competition for a place on singing tutorials .  The first production The text for the first term's production will usually be selected for the purpose of getting a new group to work together rather than trying to go for detailed individual The piece tests the actor's  awareness and imagination to the full ,
	 but nevertheless makes precise demands on him :  he must follow exactly what the author says .  Throughout drama school there will be continuous work on acting solo pieces ,
	 and both singing and acting tutorials are usually conducted on a one to one basis  ( more on tutorials in chapter 7 )  .  Of course the student also needs to learn how to co - ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary actions and movements which are part of the natural traffic of Unfortunately ,
	 it is often difficult to get agents to attend these productions .  Most drama schools final productions are staged over a similar sort of  schedule ,
	 which means agents are asked to see students'  work over a fairly compressed period .  Agents are notified of AMANDA I don't think there's  a style of voice ,

I mean the most exciting moment of all is when you are actually chosen for a part  after that initial excitement it's  a bit downhill  not because the work isn't marvellous but because the first challenge is the peak .  I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual I think everyone needs the director to be vitally interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual performance .  In the West End there seems at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actors which is often accompanied by a failure to maintain a true interest in what is going on for the actor .  Perhaps directors in particular need to realise how much their vitality means to the continuing D.S. Not at all .

There are two basic questions .  First ,

	 for example ,
	 the investigation of human amnesia  ( severe loss of long - term memory function as a result of brain damage )  .  A set of amnesics is first assembled on the basis of their low scores on a clinical memory test .  Their In one memorable instance ,

It was intended as a high - But the new two - axle units were actually responsible for part of the upsurge in traffic on their routes and were certainly no worse than the buses with which they were successfully competing .  Meanwhile ,
	 however ,
	 it had become clear that there had to be a replacement DMU which was placed midway in size and cost between the railbuses and the 210 units .  But ,

The second meaning of the word impetus should be applied to the actual Or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space ,
	 such as the moment in a grand jet en avant  when the dancer's  two legs are at an equal height from the ground and he or she appears to travel onwards effortlessly through space .  It can also be the moment when a dancer moves into a pirouette  and spins before holding a pose .  However ,

This can be most effective in cases where the dancer takes a slow preparation into a firm but slight demi - pli  then suddenly rises  and turns five or six times .  This kind of bravura The above definition may at first seem to have little to do with a choreographer's  work .

	 while the American market for current art is unprecedented ;  it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world .  The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of art to public collections also At the end of the twentieth century group exhibitions perhaps do not have the importance that they have had earlier in the century .

	 and if it gets complicated there is something quite wrong .  Above all acting is not an intellectual occupation ,
	 though a good mind is needed to respond imaginatively and practically to the work of authors and directors .  An actor can wear his cap as an academic in private conversation as well as the next person ,
	but once on stage the actor responds to the requirements of a scene being Here is an example of an impro exercise for two actors :  An actor is asked to assume the character of a close family friend who arrives at the house with the news of the death of the wife's  husband in an accident .  He has hurried to get there and tell the wife before the police arrive .  This may prove more effective if the girl And class work in this area is usually referred to as technique or simply acting .  For example ,

	 a full term of productions may mean that at least three or more plays will be staged ,

	which means they have the opportunity to ( On the other hand ,
	 plays like Tom Stoppard's  Jumpers  or Max Frisch's  Andorra  offer good opportunities for large numbers of students .  )  Quite clearly the most important thing about final presentations is that the play suits the talent available in the group .  Yet every now and again a student emerges who shows exceptional talent and it is quite natural that a drama school will make sure that his/her ability is given a good stretch in public with a major role ,
	perhaps Many drama schools regard musical productions as a main attraction ,
	 and shows such as Cabaret ,
	 Guys and Dolls  and Chicago  often get presented very well ,
	 with good choreography and musical direction which supports the cast very well .  The ability to sing and dance has become increasingly important in the profession nowadays ,

Nobody wants a florid letter from someone they have never seen before but as an actor your style and personality must come through sufficiently  a bare list of parts played won't convey much .

Serious conversation about alcohol is reserved for wine and spirits .  Yet beer good beer is a highly complex product and one that arguably needs greater skill to As the roots begin to break out of the grains the barley is transferred to a vast hall heated with warm air and turned by large malt shovels .  When the maltster is satisfied that germination has unlocked the rich natural sugars in the barley ,
	 the grains are taken to a kiln room where heat stops germination .  The temperature of the kilning process determines the type of malt Yeast is made up of millions of tiny fungus cells which literally go berserk when confronted by a liquid rich with sugars .  Within a few hours a scum appears on top of the wort and this rapidly builds up into a great yellowy - brown crust as the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide .  The system used in Britain to Keg ,
	 which includes lager ,
	 is known in the industry as brewery conditioned beer .  Instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to add a full ,

At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ;  yet during 1988 alone ,

	 Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses .  More recently ,

	 which is an economical practice ,
	 especially in the case of outstanding vegetables ,
	 flowering plants and sports or other unusual forms .  It is not really worth saving seeds from F1 hybrids or from most fruit varieties as these rarely reproduce true to type .  Variegated varieties will often For these reasons ,
	 when tackling the problem of gardening in the shade it is important to choose plants proficient at extracting energy from limited sunlight .  Mere tolerance of shade is not enough .  Some species may be receiving sufficient light to grow plenty of healthy foliage ,

	 when the wind has picked up ,
	 the gliders weathercock round and can be free to tip over so that the into - wind wing is upwards .  Another hazard is the wind swinging and increasing during the day so that the glider ends up parked facing directly into the wind .  If the glider is facing across the wind with the into - wind wing held down ,
	the wind will be blowing on to its top surface ,
	It is a frightening experience ,
	 and I have never heard of anyone doing it a second time .  With a trailer that you have not towed before ,
	 your first priority should be to explore its stability carefully .  You can do this by driving on a quiet ,
	wide road with no traffic about ,
	gradually increasing your speed and moving the steering slightly to In flight ,
	 the directional or weathercock stability is maintained by the fin and rudder ,
	 which provide extra side area behind the c.g .  Thus with the aileron and rudder held in a central position ,
	 a glider will always weathercock into line with the relative airflow ,
	 just as the wind vane on a church steeple will always swing into the wind .  When rudder is applied ,

	 the effect of the wind gradient accentuates the climb so that the glider may easily be left flying close to the ground ,
	 in or near the wake and below the tug .  Then ,
	when the glider pilot recognises he is far too low ,
	any quick movement to regain position takes the glider up through the same wind gradient ,
	causing a sudden surge of speed and Never having shown the same propensity as the French for violent revolution ,
	 the dispossessed have entered into a complex ritual of action within the processes of the criminal justice system ,
	 and in doing so have encouraged those tasked with their containment to consider them as being less than human and therefore needing further control and discipline .  As Wilson  ( 1981 )  ,
	 Reiner  ( 1985 )  ,
	 and others have clearly identified ,
	 policing is basically a socio - political tool of the state and government .  It is sustained by an intimate knowledge of its enemy the underclass of society and exemplary use is made of this knowledge to Such a mood of concern has existed now for more than a decade and seems to mirror uncertainties of role occurring elsewhere in society .  For example ,
	 it can be argued the expansion into amalgamated police units has enlarged the organization to a point where it is no longer accessible to the man in the street ;  alternatively ,
	 it may be that the use of a centralized computer and complex technical aids has alienated the public even at the same time they are increasingly fed a diet of violent news snippets which reinforce a fear of crime and generate another folk devil of criminal menace ,
	 which demands the impossible :  a policeman on every corner .  In nightly theatrical TV rituals of social order and chaos ,
	a stream of hero - policemen stand at the symbolic crossroads between peace and mayhem ,
	and the detective and the chief officer now operate at the point where once the church and its priests declaimed on categories of good and evil and the resulting binary codes they the report is certainly not a definitive and unchallengeable portrait of the Metropolitan police .  In later ,
	 calmer moments ,
	 those conclusions which are not based on published research material need to be contested .  There is a world of difference between research findings based on safe academic principles and methodology ,
	and those Nor will he be able to take a sabbatical to formulate the complex structures of meaning lodged deep in the empirical material ,
	 which Lvi - Strauss  ( 1976 :  80 )  has argued are capable of linking together symbolic and metaphoric programmes to reveal properties not immediately accessible to the  ( empirical )  observation .  To coin another military metaphor ,
	 he must soldier on knowing that all of this activity might well smack of sedition .  Even the fact that someone inside is writing fieldnotes will Furthermore ,
	 as these college - based insiders stress ,
	 their essays do not represent police college views or those of the Home Office ;  and both Thackrah  ( 1985 )  and his publisher ,
	 James Tindall ,
	 take pains to ensure from the outset that we are aware than any views expressed in the book are those of individual contributors ,
	 and not those of the college ,
	 the Home Office ,
	 or even the police service .  One might suggest then that the major project Holdaway recognized was missing from the college inventory is still to come !  Indeed the anonymous reviewer of the Pope and Weiner edition went on to propose that if the police staff college is to fulfil its task of questions were being raised about what the police were doing ,
	 what they ought to be doing and how they ought to be organised and accountable .  The fact that these questions are being raised has significance for the authority of the police and it is the single most important determinant of the style of policing .  Thus we need to explore in more concrete terms the operational aspects of the questions and the dilemmas they He dismissed this as irrelevant and his use of metaphor ,
	 in what  turned out to be an eighty - minute interview ,
	 was most revealing .  I later recorded he invariably used the idea of an escape from real work to describe any research secondment ;  in doing so he embodied the common institutional fear of uncontrolled social movement across a divide or boundary into another society such as academia .  This is part of the ideological pedagogy which the institution uses to create and maintain defensive boundaries against the outsider or those who might To have advanced within the job and achieved rank means he is likely to have followed and supported institutional precedents without question ,
	 and to have unwittingly accepted and been involved in the reproduction of the narrow modes of thought and practice demanded by the culture .  It is this special knowledge ,
	 or gnosis ,
	 which hopefully can make the inside ethnography so different and illuminating .  Burridge ( 1969 ) has written most persuasively about the effects which fieldwork can have on the anthropologist ,
	describing the prophetic experience this can By consciously using subjectivity as a research tool ,
	 the insider is peculiarly placed to generate what Geertz  ( 1976 )  described as an inward conceptual rhythm ,
	 moving between the particular and the general .  Hopefully ,
	 he can use the creativity which exists between the experiential inside view and observational outside view of a cultural system to formulate an ethnography which incorporates a continuous dialectical ,
	 tacking between the most local of detail and the most global of global structures in such a  way as to bring them into simultaneous view  ( Geertz ibid .  235 )  .  But it is not just how the new consciousness is to be used which Once the semantics of police experience were revealed ,
	 I had to live with the problems experienced by both Castenada and Favret - Saada ,
	 although I demur from casting myself into their intellectual companionship .  Reality itself then became a construct of knowing and being known ,
	 and of living with the alternative possibility .  For personal transitions made across physical and psychic boundaries during the subjectivity of the field situation can By  defining  this insider fieldwork  ( and the university experience which generated it )  as a liminal situation ,
	 I am extending the Turnerian concept  ( 1969 ,
	 1974 )  in which the individual moves temporarily into an unstructured and somewhat ambiguous state ,
	 during the initial process of passing through a rite de passage  before returning to structure .  Here the marginality is less transitory and occurs in the post - tribal situation where the concept of liminality is less familiar to the discipline ,
	 even though transitions across spatial and temporal boundaries still create epistemological changes of the kind Turner describes .  In my own case ,
	the model of transition through liminality might still I suspect it is no  accident the politics of the times seems to parallel the growing toughness of the police image ,
	 or that the police have taken on an increasing resemblance to the black - clothed enemies of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy films such as Star Wars ,
	 Superman  ,
	 and the like .  In these mass cultural replays of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil ,
	 the use of highly symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominates .  Within the separate police forces ,
	the nuances of uniform difference were always embroidered by real polises to His real work always lies in the bodily activity of physically capturing the prig ,
	 often to have this dangerous business transformed by a detective who then negotiates justice with the adversary ,
	 in the essential CID cause of returning a good detection rate .  As a result ,
	 the uniform polises often complain that the quality of prig has been forsaken to be replaced by quantity .  This qualitative/quantitative dilemma As a result ,
	 the uniform polises often complain that the quality of prig has been forsaken to be replaced by quantity .  This qualitative/quantitative dilemma produces a further schism between uniformed policeman and detectives ,
	 for CID systems of maximizing and negotiating both the crimes recorded and their eventual classification can drive a wedge between the two units .  Once again the result is disjunction ,
	for it is quality and not quantitative measures in the work experience which In contrast nailing the prig down is a quintessential statement about the value to uniform polises of stasis ,
	 containment ,
	 and spatial control .  Such vivid ,
	 metaphoric language epitomizes and illustrates the ultimate truths and values of the police world .  In effect ,
	even those who move across the margins into CID work have The philosophy which they never tired of expounding to us included visions of a new world ,
	 which although sketchy and inevitably idealistic often showed an artistic and positively creative side to their existence .  It was often difficult to dislike the gentle ,
	 painted hippies ,
	 even though they subscribed to a strange new communal ,
	 non - hierarchic lifestyle incorporating the unlawful use of dope .  This undermined any pre - ordained police logic we might have employed to define them ,
	so that pressures to As I have indicated ,
	 the requirements for competition are slightly different ,
	 but we can use the fitness built up through normal training to provide a platform upon which to establish more specialised requirements .  Thus you will already be aerobically fit ,

	then your first objective is to raise the level of work you can do before sliding too far into fatigue - Always taper your training down at the end of a workout ;  do not stop suddenly because this can cause fainting or dizziness .  Begin increasing training intensity as soon as you can last the 20 minutes .  Eventually ,

	thus staving off reliance on fatigue - Work at relaxing your muscles ,

	 associationism is anathema  to representational theorists like Fodor ;  and Fodor criticizes connectionism  ( see Chapter 7 )  for inheriting all the problems of associationism .  But a picture of the mind as consisting of atomic mental states causally interacting is not a million miles from the Humean view  a view of which Hume himself was the most insightful critic .  On a more phenomenological level ,
	if we wanted some visual analogue to the associationist view of mental life we could not do much better than think of one of those psychedelic slide - shows popular in the late 1960s ,
	in which lights were projected through oil ,

	 as in computerized tomographic  ( CT )  scans ;  magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei ,
	 as in nuclear magnetic resonance  ( NMR )  scans ;  or emission from radioactively labelled substances incorporated into the structure of nerve cells as in positron emission tomographic  ( PET )  scans .  These obviously have considerable clinical value for localizing and identifying areas of brain abnormality ,
	 but they also enable areas of activity in the normally functioning brain to be pictured .  The resolution of these pictures is still relatively coarse and they We have no way of knowing exactly when these experiences took place .  All we can reasonably conclude is that they happened at the same time .  A much more likely explanation of Libet's findings is simply that all experiences are delayed relative to the stimulus causing them ,
	so that synchronous external events Recent experiments on the psychophysiology of selective attention by ,
	 for example ,
	 Steven Hillyard at San Diego and Emanuel Donchin at Illinois have successfully related different endogenous components in the ERP to different stages in the process of selective attention .  Suppose a subject is listening to different sequences of sounds played independently to each ear through a pair of headphones in order to pick out and respond to a particular target sound .  If the subject is instructed to attend to one ear and ignore the sounds coming into the other ear ,
	all the sounds in the attended ear will The implication ,
	 contrary to relativism ,
	 is that certain things  ( referred to in the contemporary literature as natural kinds )   simply belong together .  If we attempt to put the wrong type of things together ,
	 or attempt separate explanations of things which are part of the same natural kind ,
	 then we are going to struggle to produce successful science .  We won't Graphemic parsing is necessary because a phoneme is often represented in English by more than one letter  ( for example ,
	 PH represents one phoneme in graph ,
	 OO represents one phoneme in boot )  .  Each grapheme is then translated into a corresponding phonemic representation on the basis of pre - established conversion rules  ( each grapheme would become associated with a particular phoneme as one's  reading skills develop )  .  Finally ,
	the phonemes are blended together to I have gone into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first ,
	 that it can be misleading to categorize patients too narrowly into groups ,
	 and second ,
	 that the dual - route model I described can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual cases .  There is an equally important additional point that I want to make .  Since brain damage can Muller's  nineteenth - century  doctrine of specific energies  formalized the ordinary observation that different sense organs are sensitive to different physical properties of the world and that when they are stimulated ,
	 sensations specific to those organs are experienced .  It was proposed that there are endings  ( or receptors )  within the nervous system which are attuned to specific types of energy ,
	 For example ,
	 retinal receptors in the eye respond to light energy ,
	 cochlear endings in the ear to vibrations in the air ,
	 and so on .  Of course ,
	high energy stimulation even of the wrong kind may stimulate a sensory ending ; for example ,
	excessive pressure on the eyeball will Intentionality is usually overlooked by causal theorists who tend to see their job as being to sort out the afferent limb .  It is therefore especially ironical that the neurophysiological CTP ,
	 which locates the basis of perception literally in the head ,

	 actually sharpens the mystery of intentionality .  For nature ,

	 that we would now be reading in the popular railway magazines a number of reports that British Rail's  Provincial sector possesses some routes which are promising to become profitable ?  Who indeed could have forecast that the Provincial sector would be announcing such an improvement in their financial situation resulting from rapid but targeted investment in new trains ,
	 with the prime objective of cost reduction ?  Certainly ,
	only eight years ago ,
	when the other sectors were given clearly defined briefs ,
	the lumping of unprofitable passenger services into a somewhat negatively titled Other Provincial Services The same work was also required in a large number of the early Mark 2 locomotive - hauled carriages ,
	 and in many long - life electric multiple units .  It emerged that across the very varied fleets the cost of asbestos removal would be 25,000 per vehicle ,
	 an investment producing no financial return .  The question had to be asked : could the purchase of new trains It was intended as a high - performance set which could inherit the reliability associated with previous BR  ( SR )  DEMUs ,
	 thus beating the older ,
	 inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple units hands down. Its problem ,
	 when analysed by the new Provincial sector was its price :  it would cost too much to enable a financial case to be made for the 210 breed to replace existing DMUs even taking asbestos removal into account .  The other design in the offing was the two - axle railbus which had started life as a Research Division project aimed at combining high - speed freightvehicle technology with that of the standard Leyland road bus in order to Some were the direct result of campaigning by the Railway Development Society and the list is almost a tribute to it .  It should be added that though this book is about BR ,
	 the 1980s also saw the opening of the last section of the Tyne  Wear Metro in March 1984 and the launch of the stillexpanding Docklands Light Railway in July 1987 .  Both No better example can be given than by citing the careers of Tamara Karsavina and Margot Fonteyn ,
	 both of whom worked with many different choreographers as well as submitting themselves to the severely classical discipline of the older Petipa repertoire .  A general view  There is a third type of choreographer who Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow :  classical ,
	 demi - caractre  ,
	 romantic ,
	 character and/or national ,
	 and modern  ( see pages 75138 )  .  However ,
	 when necessary ,
	  choreographers can and should create a particular style that is perhaps based on a mixture of the above but that is ,
	 in the final analysis ,
	 a style suitable for one ballet only .  Such choreographers as Ashton ,
	MacMillan and Robbins have Petipa divided movement into seven categories which other teachers have analysed further .  If these definitions were put through a computer they would list five kinds of jumps ,
	 twenty - three pas de bourre  ,
	 seven glissades  and so on .  The technical structure of each step and pose is known and years of practice in hundreds of class - rooms have He explained the gestures in the libretto he prepared for his audience .  As a Greek and Latin scholar he had found them described in the works of ancient authors who wrote about the moods ,
	 emotions and actions of all the actors involved in their dramas .  By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who The latter ,
	 after all ,
	 was the stereotype setting fur all classical ballet until 1789 ,
	 the year of the french Revolution .  La Fille Mal Garde  of 1789 was the first ballet to display the lives and loves of peasants and farmers .  Even the popularity of these lesser mortals could not drive aristocrats completely from the stage ,
	particularly in those countries where major theatres continued to be subsidised by Royal Treasuries who largely dictated what choreographers could They squawk and scratch with unturned - out feet in temps levs  and batterie  ,
	 elbows flapping and heads pecking and poking .  Petipa's  ideas about birds were followed by Ivanov's  Odette in Swan Lake  and later in Fokine's  unforgettable The Dying Swan  fur Anna Pavlova .  But by the time Fokine Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus   ( 1985 )  .  Ashton too has created two oriental styled ballets in which the delicacy of the hands and arms drew attention to the way such subtle movements can take the place of words .

It seems highly likely that most if not all the beer Flavours rapidly evaporate from hot wort while bitterness requires up to an hour to fully develop .  Brewers have been aware of this issue for centuries and have developed the practice of adding copper hops early in the boil to provide bitterness and aroma or late hops towards the end of the boil for flavour .

	 LCDs for computer terminals .  The plant In its most basic form ,
	 it comprises a single straight nickel - iron alloy core carrying two windings .  One winding functions as an excitation coil in which current flowing creates a field to magnetise the core in alternate directions .  The other acts as a pickup coil The pickup coil remains a single winding over the toroid  ( Fig. 8 )  .  By these modifications the sought - after simplicity is achieved ,
	 coupled with the virtual elimination of all high - level signals .  As an additional benefit ,
	the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core greatly reduces the drive requirements to Figure 9 represents the way in which the lines of force are concentrated from the immediate vicinity and makes plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much difference in the flux changes it experiences from either system .  An additional advantage of the ring core is that it will accept more than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientations to the external magnetic field .  For example while the coil orientation shown in Fig. 10a A gain of 400 in the first amplifier/filter will then produce an output of almost two and a half volts from the total earth's  field vector ,
	 avoiding overload and permitting a peak - to - peak measurement by rotating the core .  Calibration The core is aligned with one coil picking up the north - south field and inclined at roughly 67 to the horizontal and adjusted so as to The driver section starts with an RC oscillator made from two 4011 gates wired as inverters .  The component values are chosen to give a frequency of 720Hz .  The output is fed to a two stage frequency divider formed from the D - type 4013 bistables ,

	the Cuk power converter offers the best of all power supply worlds ,
	approaches 90 % efficiency ,
	requires few components ,
	and The low RF interference and low component count claims are usually made because the Cuk topology is not only able to accommodate the input and output filter chokes on the same magnetic core as the transformer ,
	 but it can also reduce the input and output ripple currents to very low levels .  This does indeed seem like getting something for nothing ,
	 but is it really ?  Since the input and output inductors store energy ,

The setting up of a new form of Ulster Club organization involving paramilitary activity in the wake of the Anglo - Irish accord of 1985 ,
	 is an added dimension to the struggle for power within the alliance .  It is likely that the inner core of local church laity ,
	such as select vestry members of the Church of Ireland and presbyterian elders ,
	provided and still The link between Irish catholicism and Irish nationalism is deeply rooted .  For centuries the Roman catholic church and faith were the bread of life to the subordinate classes in Ireland ,
	 deprived of their land ,
	 civil rights ,
	 and education .  The church not only The church not only provided solace and comfort in those long years ,
	 but also a vigorous identity which enabled its people to hold up their heads amid the persecution and oppression .  It provided intellectual and spiritual leadership and some alleviation from hunger and starvation .  The clergy were the only source of education apart from the hedge school teachers ( Dowling 1968 ) and What the protestant loyalists in effect seek to maintain is protestant  loyalist domination within a flexible territory ,
	 one which they feel justified in calling their land and ruling according to their conscience .  The Key Mythical Structures of Protestant  Loyalist Popular Religion It could be argued that the myths of Ulster protestantism and the institution of the Orange order take the place of the more centralized clerical organization of Roman catholicism in These principles were embodied in the constitution .  The prime reason for bringing in a new constitution in 1937 was the return to dominance of the republican grouping ,
	 the side which had lost the civil war ,
	 and which had retained the intention of establishing a republic .  The new Fianna Fil Party ,
	under the leadership of Eamon de Valera ,
	was intent on asserting Irish independence to the full by leaving the empire and It appeared that one of the main sources of the bishops'  opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation .  That the bishops were  affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme  clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented  seems likely .  Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to The new Minister for Health ,
	 Dr Noel Browne ,
	 a dedicated reformer of the health services and much concerned in particular with the eradication of tuberculosis in Ireland ,
	 modified the earlier bill to exclude the compulsion elements .  But by March 1951 ,
	 it was clear that even this reform did not satisfy the Irish hierarchy who had also been lobbied by the Irish Medical Association to oppose the scheme .  Grounds for the bishops' opposition were that only parents and not the state should have the right to Protestant churches were not unaffected by the spirit in which the campaign often appeared to be conducted .  Some members of the anti - abortion lobby had apparently been indicating the weak moral stance of protestants on the issue .  The Church of Ireland appears to have had this in mind when it invited the well - known English Roman catholic marriage consultant ,

Readers'  questions We are unable to Most private owners discovered the use of a tail and wing - tip dolly a long time ago ,
	 making it possible to tow out with a car single - handedly on most days. It is a harsh punishment to have to walk the glider all the way back ,
	 particularly after a cable break where the glider lands in the middle of the airfield .  I am always surprised that clubs will happily buy an expensive tractor to pull gliders back ,
	but will not Tow - rope loads On a car or winch launch ,
	 the pull of the rope or launching cable exerts very little stabilising effect ,
	 but the rapid acceleration usually ensures that enough speed is gained to have good control .  A nose hook Higher on the launch Higher up on the launch the drill should be :  lower the nose into the approach attitude ;  release the cable ;  assess if a landing ahead is practical .  If the latter is the case the speed should be checked by the ASI and ,
	If the latter is the case the speed should be checked by the ASI and ,
	 provided that it is adequate ,
	 the airbrakes can be used for a normal approach and landing .  Unless the failure has occurred below 50 feet or so ,
	 once the speed has been regained it is always best to apply full airbrake first to use up any excess height quickly .  The airbrake can then be reduced if necessary for the round - out and landing ,
	The following incident with an experienced pilot on a K6E drew attention to the importance of making smooth stick movements .  This particular pilot was an instructor who was in good practice in a K13 two - seater but out of practice in his K6E .  The E - model ,
	unlike the K6CR ,
	has an all - moving stabiliser with no tabs to This is slightly more than the distance that most pilots would like for a spot landing at the gliding site because you need a little more time for the approach in a strange place .  Obviously ,
	 if the fields are small ,
	 two lengths might be needed .  Then ,
	For a start ,
	 novice pilots should have some experience of aerotowing in single - seaters before converting to types which are not fitted with a nose hook ,
	 and gliders intended for inexperienced pilots should always be manufactured with a nose hook for aerotowing .  It is wise for inexperienced pilots to carry additional ballast to bring the c.g .  well forward ,
	 making the glider more stable and increasing the stick forces .  The nose heaviness will also The gliding is often spectacular :  poor landings ,
	 low final turns and generally sloppy flying .  At many clubs it is compulsory for everyone to have at least one dual flight at the beginning of the season before flying solo again .  Certainly ,
	an emergency on the first flight after a long lay off When giving instruction in thermal soaring ,
	 I try to insist that students go on attempting to find lift until about 5600 feet ,
	 and I very often explain my own thoughts and precautions as they do the flying .  All the time during each turn it is essential to have a plan for the worst contingency and to know exactly what you would do if you suddenly lost 200 feet .  In this way it is possible to use the lift low down with safety ,
	Finally ,
	 check the airspeed carefully and approach with an adequate amount of height and speed .  Try to avoid an approach which ends up with a very small amount of airbrake .  It is always easier to land with at least half airbrake Stamina - building is not the only advantage of cycling .  Because you're not carrying the weight of your body on your feet ,

Use any opportunity to force the opponent's  front hand across his own centre - line since this always inhibits his immediate responses .  Competitors generally adopt an attacking or defensive attitude which governs their usage of technique .  Thus the defensive fighter waits for you to  attack and then counters as your technique is concluding .  Don't fall for this but draw him out instead by Begin what seems to be a front kick ,

The Workplace Advisory Service advises on alcohol policies and Would it not make a difference if one identified experience ,
	 not with some disposition to overt behaviour ,
	 but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminates the various sorts of stimuli within the nervous system ?  This is a version of the supposedly post   - behaviourist theory called functionalism ,
	 which treats mental states as responding to other internal and mental states as well as to external stimuli .  The first thing to notice about functionalism is that it does not fare any better than behaviourism in It looks silly from the perspective of our so - called folk psychology of thinking .  For ,
	 paradoxically enough ,
	 it is the language of thought thesis which is closer to the layman's  intuitions about thinking .  We have a way of talking ,
	and thus a way of thinking ,
	about thoughts as if they were sentences in the head ; and it is worth noting that Fodor ( for example in Psychosemantics ) regards folk psychology as This may sound a somewhat highfalutin' way of making an obvious point ;  but the obvious points are often the important ones :  in this tension we find the limits  of experience ,
	 beyond which we locate an objective universe and within which we locate subjectivity .  ( One caveat :  I am not saying that this is the only  necessary experiential condition for objectivity :  it is ,
	 though ,
	 the one which highlights the importance of action most clearly in differentiating the objective from the subjective within the stream of experience .  )  Without the possibility ,
	then ,
	of altering one's perceptual inputs at will it is difficult to see how the information The appearance is of the wall stopping just as it reaches the board ;  but do not the input systems deliver up the information that the wall continues behind the occluder ?  Indeed ,
	 as I mentioned above ,
	 there is  plenty of evidence from research with the very young infants that their input systems allow them to make appearancereality distinctions  ( for example ,
	 apparent versus real shape )  at so young an age that the possibility that they have to rely upon records of their actions to do this is just not worth considering .  I think that this kind of objection rests upon a false way of thinking about the information that the input system The infant's  brain records the results of this modification and gradually constructs a model of reality on that basis .  It must be said ,
	 however ,
	 that despite the beautiful detail of Piaget's  behavioural descriptions ,
	 his picture of the mental reorganizations underlying behavioural change was painted with a very broad brush  ( by present - day standards )  ;  and indeed the assimilation - accommodation model is little more than a description of what has to be explained ,
	 awaiting ,
	 what we now call ,
	 a computational model .  My own view is that connectionism ( see Chapter 7 ) is well placed to Indeed ,
	 it is a common observation in experiments of this kind that subjects themselves often express confusion about what they are conscious of .  The problem arises whenever we try to use conscious awareness as a dependent variable :  for example ,
	 when we want to decide whether or not a particular external event leads to a phenomenal event .  This is an area of some controversy at the moment in psychology ,
	where one of the holy grails is the attempt to But when we talk about our conscious experiences we are providing our listener with only a very crude approximation to the actual phenomenal content of experience .  ( Interestingly ,
	 one of the functions of art is the attempt to refine this process of communicating mental states and the accounts of the artist can sometimes be a more useful guide to the nature of cognitive processes than nave introspection .  )  What I am suggesting is that introspective reports ,
	while often Consequently ,
	 I am going to start off by outlining some of the philosophical beliefs about the nature of mind which underpin contemporary research in the cognitive sciences ,
	 including cognitive neuropsychology .  This will involve a brief discussion of the approach known in contemporary philosophy as functionalism  .  The basic theme of this chapter will be that the success of cognitive neuropsychology Fodor  ( 1981 )  provides a very clear description of functionalism ,
	 and his book The Modularity of Mind  discusses some of the philosophical issues surrounding cognitive neuropsychology .  Pylyshyn  ( 1984 )   contains an important account of the relationship between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence ,
	 and Pylyshyn  ( 1973 )  contains an interesting discussion of the differences between cognitive science and phenomenology .  A very clear introduction to current work in cognitive neuropsychology is For the purposes of the present discussion I  am going to confine myself to sensation and perception and ignore behaviour .  I do this not only because the issues are easier to grasp in the case of perception than in the case of voluntary movement ,
	 but also because neurophysiologists of movement are less prone to wild claims than neurophysiologists of perception :  most of the former would admit that we do not yet have the faintest idea how voluntary activity is able to utilize or over - ride reflex pathways ;  how we mobilize so - called motor programmes when we need them ;  or even where in the nervous system voluntary movement is initiated .  The metaphysical framework for the neurophysiology of perception is Or have they ?  In the discussion that follows ,

When I visit drama schools now and I firmly believe the professional actor is someone who should The dual division of ecclesiastical power has also been important because the religious orders have often been the vehicle for innovative theologies differing from the Roman line .  Because such religious orders are themselves controlled from Rome ,

	 while it is possible to identify liberal catholicism in Ireland from the late nineteenth century to the present ,
	 and though there has grown up a climate of liberal dissent and criticism of conservative catholicism ,
	 it is still possible to assert the prominence of conservative catholicism ,
	 particularly in its alliance with nationalism .  The predominant political religious form was and We reiterate :  the dominant beliefs of the alliances which we have termed historical blocs are not necessarily shared by all but are promoted successfully by dominant groups and have some grounding in the consciousness of the wider membership .  Thus ,

	  the problem is the British presence in Ireland .  But emotionally ,
	 the non - people are hated or at least detested .  Clare O'Halloran ( 1986 ) has shown how the social reality of Northern Ireland It is adhered to by increasing numbers who have become disillusioned with British identity and have seen Paisley's  words about the traitorous nature of British governments become reality as protestant  loyalist domination in Ulster has been continuously eroded .  These are probably more likely to vote for Paisley's  democratic unionism and to come from  either religious ,
	 fundamentalist backgrounds or populist working - class and lower middle - class backgrounds .  The other tradition The republicanism of Irish socialist nationalists was of course logical in so far as they interpreted imperialism as an enemy of the indigenous population and as an expropriator of the people .  But it was thereby alien to Ulster protestant socialists .  A duality of class interests within republicanism has This combination still exists in the provisional movement especially in the South despite the officially socialist policies of Sinn Fein ,
	 as well as in the Fianna Fil party .  In parallel with the Republic ,
	 class politics has flourished even less on the protestant  loyalist side ,

Failure to conform to directives of priests and bishops were seen to break the very fabric of communion and to allow sin to enter in .  This It is the specific effect this religious form has in Ireland which is under scrutiny .  But the form as a whole should be recognized as inimical to protestants ,
	 especially when pursued in the arena of politics .  This will be considered in the One has to remember that well into the nineteenth century British identity was predicated first of all of the English .  It also tended primarily to be Anglican and only secondarily reformed .  Even when non - Anglican protestants had become accepted as citizens in England and Ireland towards the end of the eighteenth century as they already were in Scotland and Wales ,

	with the growth of suffrage ,
	catholics could never be perceived as a political threat because of the smallness of their numbers ,
	in Ireland ,
	with the growth of the home rule movement and its accompanying nationalism ,
	they could only be perceived as politically ,

	 Christ appoints Peter to lead the church he has founded .  In the other ,
	 the church is founded but taken over early on by the Popes in Rome and by priests who use magic and ritual to gain control of God's   people ,
	 thus profaning his divine word .  For the one version ,
	the Reformation is the catastrophe by which half Christendom defects from the church ,
	the church itself This version still predominates among Roman catholic laity in most countries .  For the popular protestant version ,
	 one which is still shared probably by a majority of clergymen within the protestant denominations of the North ,
	 the church re - emerges after centuries of misguidance only with the Reformation .  The protestant version has variants as to how pure this church is or whether it At this level ,
	 the power of the Roman catholic church bore directly on the institutions of government .  Dil members would act on a decision of the hierarchy once that hierarchy had said the teaching of the church was at issue ,

	 and the corresponding change in religious social ethics had remained unformulated .  In the case of the Mother and Child scheme ,
	 it was rather through withdrawal from the scene that first the politicians and later the churchmen avoided further trouble .  As will be elaborated now in further contexts ,
	it appears that the underlying reality to such difficulties was ,
	and It should be added here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type .  Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate ,
	 they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state .  But they did and still do As already stated ,
	 the clergy had sustained the catholic  nationalist populace over centuries of oppression .  Furthermore ,

	 the intention of the clergy to assume and maintain absolute control of their schools led a number of them to refuse to appoint members of the Irish National Teachers'  Organization so as to avoid trade union interference .

It's important that you Its status or  ( as importantly )  its lack of value creates complex systems of meaning which are rarely articulated ;  for the police world has similar strictures to that which Benedict  ( 1967 )  described in her attempts to understand the rigidities of Japanese culture :  men who have accepted a system of values by which to live ,
	 cannot without courting in - efficiency and chaos keep for long a fenced - off portion of their lives where they think and behave according to a contrary set of values .  Anthropological modes of enquiry are therefore programmed to steer us through the assumptions of police society ,
	so that contradictions no longer Its frenzied rejection was very different to that of the many projects listed in the Police Foundation or Home Office Registers of Research mentioned above ,
	 most of which are simply ignored and never ever receive any review .  I believe the denial of the PSI report and the furore it caused occurred precisely because it managed to get beneath the surface of police culture to explore the deep structures of belief and to comment adversely about their influence on police activities .  The invisibility in the written record ,
	which Shapland and Hobbs ( 1989 ) observed ,
	and the unrecorded information which Chatterton told the conference This total reverence to the group binds ideas of silence ,

	 and reticence together to create a positive category for belief and action and ,
	 in turn ,
	 links silence to other concepts of respect for the order of the institution .  In consequence ,
	 even the publication of an academic seminar paper carried out without formal approval could form a breach in the regulated structures of police existence and be subject to disciplinary control .  In such a world ,

	 but no explanation is given of  how they were resolved in practice .  Of course there is no perfect solution .  I had the easy choice of Obviously concerned that his analysis of the negative influence of discipline on the efficiency of systems of communication might offend or incite displeasure ,

	 accompanied by a two - line memo from a senior officer which suggested ,
	 I understand you are doing some research ;  you may find this useful .  In the following three years the thesis Research in the police ,
	 Irving further asserts ,
	 is a matter of pragmatics ,
	 eliminating philosophical enquiry into systems of belief ,
	 or how the knowledge of an ideology is transformed into action .  In the end ,
	 only the action is viable ,
	 so that all these essays tend to match the inside ethnography and are nullified by neglect or have any contentious matter treated as privileged information ,
	 for as Templeton  ( 1980 :  904 )  argues the police fear that if you have a better understanding of society ,
	 you are in a better position to change it  the very exercise they are reluctant to engage in .  Those who do go public are disloyal and there are thinly veiled attempts to dismiss the value of any revelation they make ,
	for they are expected to Since this condemnation of research opportunity ,
	 few studies have penetrated deeply beneath the sensitive skin of police culture ,
	 and even though Chatterton in his notes to my thesis argued there has been a considerable amount of participant police research ,
	 I would question whether many of these inquiries achieved the finer grain and detail' of the insider's  account ,
	 for they can never really know or tell if they have been excluded from the inner workings of police practice or prevented from gaining access to the hidden realities contained inside the heads of the constables .  Because of the litism which such an organization of control wields ,
	 it is not surprising there is difficulty in incorporating the outside researcher ,
	 or in accepting his critical findings .  And certainly that other main arm of executive control the army seems little better at this than the police ,
	for the number of participant accounts of their deep structures WPC Dick's  salutary essay  ( 1985 )  changed little and generated few ripples on the ACPO pond ,
	 while one of the most powerfully critical books on policing in recent years  ( Jones 1980 )  seems to have had little effect on the structures of the organization ,
	 except ,
	 perhaps ,
	 to help draw its author  then a chief inspector  into the ACPO ranks .  Mervyn Jones  ( ibid .  )  ,
	 in this book on organizational  behaviors  ,
	 presented some glaringly uncomfortable findings .  Critical of the way that status is attributed by the institution ,
	his thesis was that even as the service proclaims beat patrol work to be the basis of all good policework ,
	it penalizes and stigmatizes those who Men get sent back  from specialist posts to uniform duties as a punishment and the strength of this metaphorical move downwards or backwards  ( you can never move up or forwards into uniform )  is not lost on young officers .  Few prior to Jones had cared to admit this seditious point except in the columns of the Police Review  ,
	 where disgruntled beat officers  ( often anonymously )  indicate the paradox of being the revered and reviled base on which all the hierarchy is built .   Jones's book Few prior to Jones had cared to admit this seditious point except in the columns of the Police Review  ,
	 where disgruntled beat officers  ( often anonymously )  indicate the paradox of being the revered and reviled base on which all the hierarchy is built .   Jones's  book remained untouched on the shelves of Northumbria's  modest library in its first two years ,
	 even though it had good reviews ;  and the influence of his research has been all but negligible .  For even though some attempt to give status to the community or home beat officer has been made following Lord Scarman's ( 1981 ) report on the Brixton riots which gave something of a slap on the wrist to the service ,
	the deference accorded to specialist posting or to detective work Any need to analyse the ways in which the multi - variant police world forms a coherent and self - sustaining whole is material for the social scientist and not the practitioners ,
	 for they already live the system as a matter of course .  The police ,
	 therefore ,
	 have little to gain in promoting any exploration of their modes of thought ,
	 for analysis can only hold the possibility that the whole intricate system ,
	 to paraphrase Lvi - Strauss  ( 1967 )  ,
	 will be revealed as an immense disorder which is organised in the form of a grammar .  In consequence ,
	police ethnography Favret - Saada's  unique analysis  ( ibid .  128 )  of the bizarre subjective position she found herself in is a masterful assessment of the difficulties which arise when the ethnographer seeks to gain  knowledge of a social group which depends for its existence on misknowledge or silence :  For anyone who wants to understand the meaning of such a discourse ,
	 there is no other solution but to practise it oneself ,
	 to become one's  own informant and to try and make explicit what one finds unstatable in oneself .  for it is difficult to see how the native could have any interest in the project of unveiling what can go on existing only if it I joined the uniform branch on foot patrol in the city centre division of Newcastle upon Tyne City Police .  Immediately I was instructed that I had had the good fortune to be posted to the division where real polising is done There were only three divisions in the city east ,
	west ,
	and central and each of us in our own division knew we were the lite ; for just as the men in the west were certain they were best ,
	so the men from the east Like other symbolic non - verbal devices ,
	 the multi - vocal nuances of our uniform were used in a variety of other ways as boundary markers to maintain our cultural identity and define our institutional specificities .  Just as the white - coated doctors in hospitals symbolize the clean and purifying nature of the healer ,
	 so the dark uniform of the police symbolizes not just the force identity ,
	 but also the presence of the avenger ,
	 who purifies through retribution rather than by cure .  It is the marker of force and hence continues to sustain the continuing paradox of police force police service which In such inversions of social regard we can again see how movement will tend to confound the police preference for and reliance on a rigidly maintained classificatory world .  The changing values attributed to our own private delicts such as divorce ,
	 slander ,
	 adultery ,
	 debt ,
	 libel ,
	 blasphemy ,
	 obedience to church ,
	 and the like ,
	 have turned some earlier crimes into matters now governed by other social mores .  With the public appropriation of certain categories of property ,
	however ,
	the police have been on more certain ground ,
	for the status attributed to the capture of the thief has In effect this was a time when new worlds and new social structures were being forged ;  and in many ways we were closer to the world of the underground than that of the moral majority ,
	 for we were walking the same ground and like many in the alternative society were  ( somewhat unsystematically )  following an essential and perennial theme of history  that of man's  journey as hero .  In this search for a new spiritual awareness ,
	 they  like us  were finding new possibilities to achieve a revived sense of what it is to be truly human in the transformational experience .  This is basically the same anthropological journey pursued by Lvi - Strauss ( 1973 ) in Tristes Tropiques ,
	which When policemen label one of their colleagues with the term academic it is always a derogatory term of reference ,
	 while college  man is another derisory phrase used to define that tiny percentage who gain accelerated promotion through one of the special course or graduate entry schemes generated through the police staff college .  Whitaker  ( 1979 :  229 )  records how these college men are described sardonically at police station level ,
	 as plastic men  who know all about how to hold a knife and fork ,
	 but nothing about how to catch villains .  During a sojourn in Northumbria one of these academic high - flyers When deciding how wide to make your stance ,

Nevertheless it Training To conclude this section it is necessary to point out a few things about the squad training sessions .  Firstly ,

	 a response ;  that cut through the emollient patter and posed a rough demand on the reader or hearer .  In order to get that response he was prepared to dispense with the niceties of convention and the formulae of polite language :  from the gut ,
	 to the gut .  It was exactly what Leonard expected of a poet ,
	and he and Layton have Ondaatje perceived this and described the book as being far nastier and more frightening than Flowers For Hitler  ;  but the choice of words is unjust :  there is nothing nasty or frightening about honest observation .  Such value - judgments surely arise out of the critics'  disappointment at finding negative aspects in an otherwise positive projection ,
	 an all -   to   - human aspiration for avoiding reality which Leonard refuses to do ,
	 to his great cost .  Manzano has drawn attention to a real difference when he says ( of both these first books ) ,
	In general Cohen is lyrical in his writings when he refers to himself ,
	and anarchistic when he confronts the outside world ,
	a comment which becomes more fully justified as time goes by ,
	though Leonard's anarchism Descartes believed firmly that universals were formed in the mind and that ideas possessed objective and formal reality ;  that is ,
	 that it was an irreducible feature of ideas that they were able to be about  a class of objects .  Descartes is true to his radical dualism :  everything that is a mark of mind is withdrawn into the mind ,
	 leaving the external world in atomistic darkness .  But mind It reduces language to an uninterpreted formal system .  All we know about As ,

They should be placed where horses can have free access to them without the fear of being trapped and hurt by a more aggressive horse higher in the pecking order .  It is essential to provide It is essential to provide shelter for horses to protect them from the extremes of heat ,

	 horses always like to spend some of each day on the tops of the hills :  they need to satisfy their desire for the space and freedom that a hilltop provides .  So ,

	 with the bare minimum of furniture .  There is no outside view of any Our American friend's  cousin in London is an art student .  Her college library has interesting books ,
	 as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list ,
	and the library staff are good at helping students with all Things are not so simple ,
	 as some art historians write well about the present ,
	 with a generosity of feeling and approach enriching to contemporary culture .  They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,
	 partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,
	who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,
	was an open - minded historian of this Indeed ,
	 there are some who feel that there should be no border ,
	 thinking back nostalgically to days when there was only one domain of art .  In some writing today ,
	 too ,
	 it is possible to find the words critic and historian being used interchangeably .  Art is after all the subject of attention for both critic and historian ,
	even though the functions and methods of the two A guide to art reference books published in 1969 had 2,500 entries ,
	 some of which referred to series ;  for example ,
	 there was a single entry for the series of monographs on individual artists ,
	 called Klassiker der Kunst  ,
	 also published in French as Classiques d'Art  ,
	 in which there are thirty - eight books .  This guide was extensively revised over nine  years ,
	 and was republished in 1980 as a Guide to the Literature of Art  History ,
	 intended for persons doing serious research in the field of art history .  Another Moreover ,
	 other cultures ,
	 such as those of Africa ,
	 have had to wait until even more recent times for recognition .  It is literature within the last three centuries ,
	 then ,
	 that provides the main choices for a reader .  The advice offered here is that a reader should ignore what category of writing a book or article may come under ,
	since helpful art criticism may be found in all Academies of art ,
	 whether in the West or in the Orient ,
	 have had lists of priorities in themes of art ,
	 in which there are many similarities .  For example ,
	 in twelfth - century China ,
	 a catalogue of the Imperial collection had ten headings :  Taoist and Buddhist subjects ,
	 human affairs ,
	 palaces and other buildings ,
	 foreign tribes ,
	 dragons and fishes ,
	 landscapes ,
	 animals ,
	 flowers and birds ,
	 ink bamboos ,
	 and finally vegetables and fruit .  This A first broad division between types of exhibitions needs to be made .  There are shows which could be grouped under the heading of historical exhibitions ;  there are mixed exhibitions and group exhibitions of works by living artists ;  and there are exhibitions in dealers'  galleries ,
	 notably solo shows .  The catalogues which accompany these events have rather different characters ,
	for although there are entries for the exhibited works in each It celebrates creativity amid doubt and despondency  creativity as energy but also as a duty ,
	 work to be done by man as it is the sun's  task to shine .  I have pointed out to him that his picture echoes the medieval and Renaissance formula for St John on Patmos writing the Book of Revelation and for the evangelists writing the Gospels ,
	 itself derived from Greco - Roman author portraits .  This was not his intention but iconographical echoes of this An example is the catalogue of paintings by Nol Coward ,
	 which was prefaced by a memoir of the playwright ,
	 describing his interest in painting .  In marketing a sale of rather little - known works ,
	 too ,
	 there may be some explanatory text .  It would be wrong to dismiss this In marketing a sale of rather little - known works ,
	 too ,
	 there may be some explanatory text .  It would be wrong to dismiss this sort of criticism as mere sales talk ,
	 particularly in grand auctioneers'  catalogues ,
	 though there is little danger of such publications being reticent .  Part of the charm of a sale is that the financial result is in itself a Some of the work for a museum catalogue may have already been done before the acquisition of a picture .  It may ,
	 for example ,
	 have been part of a private collection which itself was catalogued ,
	 especially if the collector in question was rich .  In this respect ,
	the scholarly standard of a private collection's catalogue will be very high ,
	and the The quotation is from an article of 1954 ,
	 at a time when Picasso's  reputation was very high .  Heron was anxious to point out Braque's  qualities ,
	 so he trailed his coat openly .   To suggest ,
	as I do ,
	that Georges Braque is the greatest living painter is to remind a contemporary audience ,
	fed to satiety on brilliant innovation ,
	frenzied novelty and every Tom Taylor ,
	 mentor and leader ,
	 had died before the group had its first exhibition ,
	 but remains classed with his friends .  They subsequently developed individual styles and separate interests ,
	 as is true of most groups of artists ,
	 but their initial appearance was defined by a programme .  Another MIXED EXHIBITIONS Mixed exhibitions are ideal for spotting talent ahead of the market ,
	 as well as being a significant source of income for many artists .  The most common A cynic will remember that research into the opinion - forming powers of newspapers has tended  to conclude that readers expect to have their existing views confirmed .  If so ,
	 the power of critics may be no more than the listings services offered in the papers or on posters ,
	 while real power can be found in the organisation of the art market .  A different The arguments put forward can be interesting in themselves ,
	 but their drift is often towards making the context of the art shown more understandable .  Art politics or cultural history are favourite themes for such reviewers ,
	 apart from the spectrum of cognate disciplines which may be the specialities of writers who are only occasionally concerned with art .  Thematic articles are likely to be found in two Articles of synthesis between art and other subjects may include important art criticism .  Literary theory is at present in demand as a point of reference for writing on the visual arts .  Articles on this This usefully explores some of the resolvable questions ,
	 in particular those of crucial interest to students of landscape and the human figure .  One aspect of illusion is perspective ,
	 much valued in the Western tradition .  Three Paolo Uccello would have been the most delightful and imaginative genius since Giotto that had adorned the art of painting ,
	 if he had devoted as much pains to figures and animals as he did to questions of perspective ,
	 for ,
	 although these are ingenious and good in their way ,
	 yet an immoderate devotion to them causes an infinite waste of  time ,
	 fatigues nature ,
	 clogs the mind with difficulties ,
	 and frequently renders it sterile where it had previously been fertile and facile .  But when Uccello died in his eighties ,
	 He left a daughter who could design ,
	 and a wife who used to say that Paolo would remain the night long in his study to work out the lines of his perspective ,
	 and that when she called him to come to rest ,
	 he replied ,
	 Oh what a sweet thing this perspective is !  Mathematical perspective of a Renaissance A perspective may be used which reverses the convergence of lines in the distance ;  instead ,
	 lines of perspective converge in front of the viewer ,
	 an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator used to photographs .  Again ,
	 in Chinese art perspective is different from its treatment in the West .  There is one Yet such a comment may need to be made ,
	 nevertheless ,
	 to point out the quality of a picture .  The critic who pays little notice to perspective or other means of representing the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoying the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of Impressionist pictures ,
	 whose qualities are inspired by scientific understanding of light and its effects .  In a different Are they able to look without too dominant a preconception coming from the Western tradition ?  There are amusing archaeological records in the nineteenth century of the inability of even trained artists to record what they saw ;  Assyrian figure sculptures ,
	 for example ,
	 were recorded as having unmistakably classical Greek features by an artist in the employ of the archaeologist Sir Henry Layard .  A different At the age of sixty - eight Ingres made copies of masterpieces .  Accurate copies might be made ,
	 but there is in addition a category of interpretive copy ,
	 where the  artist copies those elements which most appeal to him. This It was a Romantic notion that there were resonances in the natural world and art ;  and it was Schiller who argued that music ,
	 the visual arts and poetry always become similar in their action on the mind .  THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE Describing the object is not the only Michael J. Parsons describes his work in How We Understand Art  .  He can introduce us to some American girls and boys who spoke up about what they noticed and liked .  If Andy thought a drawing by Paul Klee looked This theory of stages in understanding art is helpful ,
	 and it will immediately be realised that the first two stages fit in with description ,
	 the next two with interpretation ,
	 while the final stage is judgement .  The theory is not so useful in defining the quality or strength of responses ,
	 and is no help in analysing the interactions of responses .  The theory is nevertheless of a Unlike many of the towns through which he has bribed his way in his Peugeot  from the coast ,

	 or unrests ,
	 and has lately been smashed and looted .  It is the At the same time ,
	 these hardships are a focus of his attention .  The two words carry a note of declamation  a note otherwise absent from Fraser's  account .  Glasser's prose is sometimes declamatory and sententious in an old - fashioned Hawksmoor  speaks the words of romantic duality ,
	 and is in a number of ways a double book .  It consists of two alternating narratives ,
	 one of which is set in the eighteenth century and the other in the present ,
	 with the earlier delivered in the first person .  Each of the two principal actors glimpses his double in passing ,
	as a reflection in a glass ,
	and each stands to the other in the same relation a relation which presupposes ,
	as in many other Gothic texts ,
	some In the second book ,
	 a photograph is spoken of which shows the pulling down of a monument to one of the Shahs  ( father or son )  in Teheran or some other Iranian city .  It is hard to be sure about the year the photograph was taken ,
	 since the monuments of both Pahlavis were pulled down several times ,
	 whenever the occasion presented itself to the people .  Here the confusions or uncertainties are the point of the passage : it doesn't matter that the particulars of the caption are missing since this Guesses are hazarded ,
	 and are quoted from interviews he conducted .  A hint of child abuse may seem to be imparted by his account of a Gothic moment which came about during a walk with her father ,
	 at nightfall ,
	 in a setting of peasants and forests .  Ursula figures as some The beauty of the earlier prose is ,
	 in part ,
	 a beauty of grace notes ,
	 the pointing of sentences ,
	 charged elegance and buoyant ,
	 intelligent wit .  In Take a girl like you  a great sentence falls like the dew from heaven during one of the scenes in Amis when a terminally drunk man endures a sexual turmoil and fiasco ,
	 is stunned by a stunning but not very nice girl .  This particular girl ,
	a model ,
	is putting Patrick in his place by going on about cars : Most of my friends have them on the firm ,
	she said ,
	with the Making difficulties just so as to be a person .  But when Patrick says that sort of thing to Jenny ,
	 he adds that she  is an exception to this law of nature .  She is not ,
	as he puts it ,
	that The difference yields a political meaning ,
	 in other words ,
	 and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows ,
	 and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so .  It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable :  the author who tells ,
	 and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist ,
	 may well ,
	 for instance ,
	 be more than capable of carnival ,
	 and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart .  But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some But perhaps it is not too simple to suggest that we are also conscious of Zuckerman as a deflection of the wrath over Roth which works by making Zuckerman responsible for the outrage .  We are conscious of what Zuckerman does for Roth :  when he helps a man to gather his spilt heart pills ,
	 it is Roth helping himself by assigning a small mercy .  In The Facts ,

	 the mind - body distinction as we know it was invented by Descartes .  He it was who conceived the idea of identifying mind with consciousness and of claiming that consciousness and its contents are radically different sods of things from bodies and their properties .  The mind is a By contrast ,
	 the metaphysical question of what the preconditions are for the world's  being accessible to thought was uppermost for Plato and Aristotle .  This is explained via the role of form  in the world .  The important thing about form ,
	in either the Platonic or Aristotelian senses ,
	is that forms are the This thought casts the world in a profoundly different light from common sense in its materialistic moment ;  and much of metaphysics can be seen as a response to it .  Aristotle was the first to try to naturalize the veins of generality that must structure any intelligible world ,
	 by saying that forms in things were individuals ,
	 not universals .  The controversy surrounding the interpretation of Aristotle's conception of form is unending ,
	but ,
	on all interpretations ,
	his objective is to give forms as great an affinity with particulars as is possible ,
	consistent with their retaining a The purport of that attack was to prove that generality could never be an intrinsic property of a mental content .  Berkeley's  reason for thinking this was that he believed mental contents to be mental images ,
	 and there cannot be a general image .  It never seemed to occur to him that a general idea might be an entirely different But even if treating our awareness of our own mental states as topic - neutral plausibly explains why we are not aware of our brains as such when we are aware of our mental states ,
	 it does not explain why knowing fully about the brain does not include knowledge of the nature of experience .  Topic - neutral knowledge is weaker than ,
	 and hence is entailed by ,
	 full knowledge ,
	 though it does not entail it .  So ,
	if the blind scientist BS knows that V is in brain state B and that B is the state usually brought about by experience of a red object ,
	then he knows that V is in some state or other of the A rather similar ,
	 and equally mistaken ,
	 line of thought which might appeal is as follows .  It might be thought that the subject's  apprehension of his own brain is more immediate  and more holistic  than any external knowledge ,
	 however complete ,
	 and that this explains the experiential difference between the two kinds of knowledge .  The scientist has essentially separate pieces of information ,
	whereas the subject has a I now turn to a consideration of some implications of the cognitive neuropsychology of face recognition for phenomenology  an approach to the mind and mental phenomena that gives prominence to introspectible phenomena understood as acts of consciousness and their immediate objects .  Phenomenologists such as Dreyfus  ( 1972 )  argue that the level of explanation utilized in cognitive science does not truly exist .  The physical brain and the world of introspectible phenomenal experience are all that there really is : no cognitive psychologist has succeeded in defining another These were eventually formalized in the Weber - Fechner law which reported a quantitative relationship between stimulus and subjective experience ,
	 the sensation increasing in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of the physical stimulus .  A quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity was subsequently demonstrated by physiologists recording from individual fibres .

	 evidence that when Pound was in Sicily he didn't go around with his eyes closed ,
	 his ears and nostrils stopped ?  For that surely is the disconcerting ,
	 downright depressing ,
	 reflection that this sorry catalogue must leave us with .  Sicily for Pound never but once had any existence that wasn't either verbal ( as in the wordplay on Trinacria or the Eleanors ) ,

	 how recent this is ,

	 later so notorious ,
	 certainly casts a sinister light on his readiness to broach these issues .  Yet these matters ,

	 doesn't that mean that we have in him a critic who attends to form ,
	 to style ,
	 at the expense of what that form and that style are used so as to convey ?  Don't we have in him a formalist ,
	 in fact an aesthete ?  This is the brickbat that has been thrown at Pound from the first ,

But one must remember that the divergent reading of the Christian myth by Reformation and Counter - Reformation is at the heart of the religious as opposed to the rough interpretation of the conflict .

	The related themes I am pursuing are difficult to keep apart ,
	 and really require a contrapuntal or fugal exposition .  But that would not make for easy writing ,
	 still less reading .  In practice one can only Hirsch has rejected this phrase as delusive and logically meaningless ,
	 and this rejection might itself be rejected as an instance of the rat - trap logic to which he is inclined ,
	 an improper attempt to define a subject in more rigorous terms than the subject requires .  Utterances about literature make sense ,
	 and are generally understood ,
	 within the form of life in which they are habitually made .  Nevertheless ,
	long before Hirsch ,
	C. S. Lewis wrote that many discussions about literature are discussions of a nonentity ; for Lewis ,
	literature was about as non - specific a term as By dropping the novel and other kinds of drama ,
	 more time would be provided for the extensive reading of poetry which is so essential if one is to make sense of any one poem .  There might be regrets over giving up the novel ,
	 but after having been deeply interested in that form for many years  ( even to the extent of writing one )  and often teaching courses on the novel ,
	 I have come to the conclusion that the pedagogic difficulties involved are extreme .  Percy Lubbock ,
	at the end of The Craft of Fiction ,
	acknowledged that as soon as we have finished reading a novel we begin to forget it ,
	and what is left to The most demanding would be one I have previously raised :  namely ,
	 that though the successful encounter with a poem may result in a unique aesthetic experience ,
	 academic practice demands that it be turned into non - aesthetic discourse .  Furthermore ,
	 not everyone who is invited to respond to an admired poem will have any such experience .  And although The case of Virgil is a crucial one For anyone for whom literary education  like any other  is an exploration of the meanings we have and live by ,
	 so far as we do live by meanings ,
	 Virgil and Dante are connecting rooms To If we read Ash - Wednesday through with Tate's  commentary at our elbow ,
	 we see at any given point what he means :  he has a good ear ,
	 as we might expect from his own poems  ( which are however metrical ,
	 as Ash - Wednesday isn't )  .  And we may agree that what binds together the six parts of Ash - Wednesday is in large part something rhythmical .  It remains true that in Tate's criticism and since ( for no advance has been made in this quarter ) rhythm and movement are wholly impressionistic you hear what the critic is Take for example the peasant who visits the mausoleum housing Mao's  corpse in Tiananmen Square .  Where is Mao ?  I want to He linked public readings of the book in New York with the rape of a young ,

	 I am Her college library has interesting books ,
	 as well as the latest art magazines .  Her course teacher has given her a reading list ,
	 and the library staff are good at helping students with all sorts of interests .  As part of the course ,
	she has to choose a subject of her own about which to She is looking for critical views against which to pitch her own ;  it seems that she may have chosen the wrong sort of topic ,
	 since on a holiday in Italy she had been stunned by the newly renovated Michelangelo ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome ,
	 and although there were plenty of books about it ,
	 many of them went into extravagant detail .  Happily her supervisor has guided more than one student through topics about Michelangelo ,
	 and has a route map prepared ,
	 including introductory and background books ,
	 but also passages from longer scholarly works .  If the two girls compare notes one day ,
	the New Yorker will complain about the useless articles she read ; the newspaper articles were almost always short ,
	To her surprise ,
	 there proved to be perceptive judgements about qualities in Michelangelo's  work ,
	 almost hidden in catalogue entries ;  more than one art historian ,
	 apparently ,
	 was not only learned but had an eye .   ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY Do art historians They are capable of assessing modern art in its own terms ,
	 partly from experience gained through judging work of other periods within quite different terms .  Meyer Schapiro ,
	 who had a specialist concern with Romanesque art ,
	 was an open - minded historian of this sort .  He Roger Fry acknowledged German scholarship as a precursor of serious art historical studies in this century .  Fry was a connoisseur of Renaissance art ,
	 but also he defended Post - Impressionism  ( a term he invented )  ,
	 was a painter ,
	 and published a monograph on Czanne .  In 1933 he A guide to art reference books published in 1969 had 2,500 entries ,
	 some of which referred to series ;  for example ,
	 there was a single entry for the series of monographs on individual artists ,
	 called Klassiker der Kunst  ,
	 also published in French as Classiques d'Art  ,
	 in which there are thirty - eight books .  This guide was extensively revised over nine  years ,
	 and was republished in 1980 as a Guide to the Literature of Art  History ,
	 intended for persons doing serious research in the field of art history .  Another sort of writing about art is what artists themselves have But ,
	 seeing that a fine picture is nature reflected by an artist ,
	 the criticism which I approve will be that picture reflected by an intelligent and sensitive mind .  Thus the best  account of a picture may well be a sonnet or an elegy as for criticism properly so - called To be just ,
	that is to say ,
	to justify its existence ,
	criticism should be partial ,
	passionate and political ,
	that is to say ,
	The internal politics of Surrealism were complicated by rivalries and ideological disputes ;  in the case of Andr Breton's  association with Dali ,
	 his earlier support gave way to a denunciation of the artist ,
	 who was expelled from the group .  Another famous figure ,
	 Joan Mir ,
	 initially praised by Breton as the most Surrealist painter ,
	 later described his Surrealist phase as having lasted only for a matter of months .  A personal friend of an artist may have a real advantage in Writing on  were unaffected by French bourgeois taste .  Like Apollinaire ,
	 they saw a rift between the old century and the new .  Gertrude Stein later Such polarities were evidently valuable aids to several generations of Wlflinn's  pupils who could benefit from his personal teaching as well as the rather more rigid theory in his books .  Wlflinn used such terms to distinguish epochs ;  they are only partly useful as interpretation ,
	 since Wlflinn tended to be more interested in art as an independent phenomenon than as having meaning intended by the artist .  Wlflinn Occasionally a book has almost achieved immortality ,
	 like John Ruskin's  Stones of Venice  ,
	 but even more modest books can call up the spirit of a place ;  and a private letter may illuminate both a person and a work of art .  It is easy to sympathise with a traveller who writes :  I have seen a quantity of things here  churches ,
	 palaces ,
	 statues ,
	 fountains and pictures ;  and my brain is at the moment like the portfolio of an architect ,
	 or a print - shop ,
	 or a common - place book .  This is from one of the letters Interpretation of the artist's  work ,
	 however ,
	 depends on the artist's  own account ,
	 since Nordenfalk had the deliberate intention of presenting Van Gogh the writer and thinker .  The sober intentions of his book were very different from the novels ,
	 plays and films which have created a mythical figure in modern culture of the artist as isolated and neglected ,
	 recognised only after his death ,
	 and whom the phrase genius and madness are near aligned seems to fit .  The novel Lust for Life by Irving Stone ,
	published in 1934 ,
	is the most famous of these productions ,
	popularising a vein of interpretation established early in the century by some of Van Gogh's first advocates ,
	such as the taste - maker Julius Meier - Graefe ,
	who defended Van Gogh in 1906 ,
	and went on to ARTISTS OWN WRITING Van Gogh is famous not only for his art ,
	 but for his writing .  He did not What private letters from an artist can do best is to elucidate what was uppermost in an artist's  mind at the time ,
	 often artistic aims which would be difficult to discover otherwise .  Besides which ,
	 there are some artists whom it is a pleasure to know even a little better from their letters .  Many readers must have sighed with regret that so few of Gainsborough's letters have survived ,
	since the charm of his style is so fresh ; it is easy to sympathise with him Writing on Auguste Rodin can make the point .  According to George Heard Hamilton ,
	 Rodin became a figure of international significance ,
	 the most admired ,
	 prolific ,
	 and influential sculptor since Bernini .  His secretary ,
	the poet Rainer Maria Rilke ,
	The interpretation of imagery ,
	 the circumstances of production ,
	 the place of the work in the artist's  career ,
	 the historical context ,
	 the precise information about the work's  appearance and condition ,
	 these are things that can be fully discussed in a monograph .   VERSATILE ARTISTS A monograph on an artist who practises in several fields can be unusually interesting ,
	since the writer's brief is to EXHIBITION CATALOGUES Exhibitions are major arenas for spectators of art ,
	 as well as for artists'  struggles to achieve reputations and recognition .  This section will consider not what the critics The subtitle of the show was Women artists move into the mainstream ,
	 1970  1985 .  The catalogue is 300 pages long with eight essays ,
	 as well as artists'  biographies .  In this instance the individual exhibited items are unnumbered and put in a check list ; the main critical writing is within 136 pages ,
	A dealer will have chosen his critic with special care for an introduction ,
	 an ideal candidate often being a sympathetic friend ,
	 perhaps a curator .  In 1904 Sidney Colvin was Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum .  Colvin had known Burne - Jones ,
	and was persuaded to ( a )  references to signatures ,
	 inscription and dates refer to the present state of the work ;    ( b )  the term bears a signature and/or date and/or inscription means that in our opinion the artist's  name and/or date and/or inscription have been added by another hand ;   ( c )  the term signed and/or dated and/or inscribed means that in our opinion the signature and/or date and/or inscription are from the hand of the artist .  Such caution is prudent in a business where errors of judgement can be extremely expensive ;  at least the reader of an auction catalogue knows clearly what view has been taken by the cataloguer on a number of questions .  The auction catalogue can also quote from other authorities ,
	which will be inevitable in a case where a scholar has I couldn't understand why I'd not been killed when there were so many others who It took me a long time to accept the fact that now I should not be killed  that I should be one of the survivors .  After all that I was going to live on alone to The new student does not perform to audiences immediately ,
	 and the first term's  production project will probably only be attended by staff teaching voice ,
	 movement and acting to enable individual assessments to be made on training .  Improvisation There have been many books If any professional person has shown an interest in your work don't let it go ,
	 but try to cultivate their interest ,
	 however tenuous it may seem  you will soon know if it's  going to be any use for the future .  In the first place you are your own agent .  You are entering the market for the first time when you Yes .  There's  lots of new plays being written that I look at and say Oh yes  there's  lots of opportunities there .  I mean ,
	Sugar and Spice for example by Nigel Williams ; I'd love to have a go at doing the part of Sharon sometime ,
	I think anything that is well I mean ,
